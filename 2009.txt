Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Critical bug fix
Message-ID: <49613283.2060905@hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello all yade users, and happy new year. :)

I just (r1605) commited a fix for a bug introduced recently (kn was not 
registered with interaction physics, I still don't know when it was 
introduced exactly).
If you see a strange behaviour when reloading a scene, consider updating 
your version.
The bug is invisible if you just run a TriaxialTest from scratch (no 
interaction in the initial state), but you can't miss it if you 
run/save/reload.
If you didn't notice anything wrong, don't worry : you probably didn't 
download the wrong code. This is not the sort of bug you would not notice...

Bruno

It's very simple to check who introduced this bug, just do:

  svn blame pkg/dem/DataClass/InteractionPhysics/ElasticContactInteraction.cpp

And you will see that it's Jean Francios Jerrier.

To see who was working with this file before just do:

 svn blame pkg/dem/DataClass/InteractionPhysics/ElasticContactInteraction.cpp at 1554
 svn blame pkg/dem/DataClass/InteractionPhysics/ElasticContactInteraction.cpp at 1187

The numbers I'm using are the last modification - 1, from earlier 'svn blame'

Message-ID: <4964719B.7020509@univ-nantes.fr>

Hi everybody,

   I use Yade-0.12rc1

In the engines "GlobalStiffnessCounter" and "ElasticContactLaw" are 
defined the boolean "Momentrotationlaw" set by default equal to "1".

I don't find (maybe because I am just coming back from holidays) for 
what and where is used this boolean (and which are the consquences to 
fix its value to 1 or 0). Have you got an idea?

Besides, I don't find the engine related to the definition of the moment 
rotation law, do you know where is this engine?

   Thank you for your help.

     Luc

Sorry for late reply. Better if you ask this stuff on the mailing
list. I simple missed your email before (and I'm also late with
reading the mailing list...) So for example Vaclav or Bruno could
answer you.

Yes, please modify SConscript so that it will compile your stuff. And
please update the Changelog too (everyone should be doing it, but I
still have problems with enforcing that on people, those yade
developers are like a herd of cats, and I was never good at herding
cats).

Hi all,

  I would like to know if anyone has yet downloaded via svn an old file on
the serveur
Example: extra (the folder placed in /trunk) for the version r1575.

If you are realized it, can you give me your sequence of instructions.

Hi Vaclav,

  You are right, you haved showed me in Aussois a cylindrical object made
by facets.
In fact, my supervisors would like a "true" cylinder in order to avoid the
angle creates  between two facets (the juncture). 
  Instead of recreate an existing object, I become informed. Because I
don't know everything users have developed into Yade.  

Thank you along with Janek for your reply

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Subversion checkout/update issue
	under Windows
Message-ID: <49733185.1080501@free.fr>

Hello,

I'm new to yade and tried to checkout source code from the subversion 
repository.

Whenever I checkout or update my local yade folder, I get the following 
error:

In directory 'C:\Developpement\Libraries\yade\doc'
Can't move 'C:\Developpement\Libraries\yade\doc\REMOVED.tmp' to
'C:\Developpement\Libraries\yade\doc\REMOVED': Acc?s refus?.

I'm under Windows (XP) and guess the problem comes from a conflict 
between the 'removed' folder and the 'REMOVED' file. Windows is not case 
sensitive for files/folders names as Unix/Linux/MacOSX can be.

Best regards,

Thomas Paviot

thanks for reporting. I've fixed it in the latest commit.

But anyway yade is not going to compile on windows, unless you've got
skills for doing that. Technically it's possible, but you will need
to modify some code for that.

If you manage to compile yade on windows, please send us a diff of
your modifications, or commit it yourself to the repository!

Hi, Janek:

Personally I anticipate very much a windows version of YADE, although I myself currently have no time to do this. Since we should aware the potential users of YADE, a large percent of the users would be from Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering community. If we keep compile YADE purely on Linux, I am afraid we might lose some potential users: the learning curve for Linux and YADE is way much longer than windows, although we can argue Linux is a good, free, open source system, but I did see some people gave up and turned to sth like PFC, typing command and debugging source codes is not a mandatory training for most Civil Engineers. In a word, can we make things easier? :-)

In that case, you will have to create it yourself... Shouldn't be too
difficult: geometrical model, interacting geometry, GL functors;
functors colliding cylinder with sphere (giving SpheresContactGeometry).
That's it. You could make simulation with planar facets first, though,
to see if the junction effect is important to justify all this work.

1. If you can, can you make it a little bit more generic, like having
different radii at the top and at the bottom, that would give us cones
(for r1=0, r2>0 etc), frustum (r1!=r2) and cylinder (r1==r2)? I can help
you if you need, no problem.

2. Reflect on whether you will allow interactions with the lateral
surface only, or with the lateral surface edges also (singular points!)

I don't have any windows machine by hand where I could test things. But
it there are people creating (and maintaining) the port, I don't see
problem with that. Let me add, though, that I don't have time to
actively support that at this moment, nor do I think it is that
important for yade: it is not mature enough (e.g. compared to pfc) to be
used by people who don't know how to type a command and debug source code.

There are a few problems that will be faced for sure when working on
pure-windows port (no cygwin):
1. scons works under windows, but SConstruct file contains a few
UNIX-isms, like / for path separator and default directories.
2. the plugin loader may have issues (not sure).
3. at a few places, POSIX (but not standard libc) functions are used.
The qt gui has a few calls to xlib functions as well.
4. some gcc extensions are being used (like __attribute__), they will
not work with other compilers.
(5. If windows-specific things begin to complicate source code, the
advantage of relatively homogeneous development platform will be lost
and many devs will grumble about that (me inclusive).)

Hi, Vaclav:

I agree that one don't know how to type command and debug source code might not be good to use YADE:-), however, is there a way that we can first compile a pure null-gui interface on windows (I think it can either on cygwin or use mingw), so we can avoid any platform related GUI issues like qt, xlib, etc?

Hi All,
Now a days again I am losing myself to understand Radius Expansion(RE) as well as REFD(Radius Expansion Friction Decrease Method).

Well, in RE method the particle size is different from the initial particle size, that can be anticipated by Rmin/m, and Rmax/m.Which is uniform for all particle as multiplied by same factor.

But in REFD, when isotropic then the particle radius and in maximum porosity state, when friction is reduced then particle state and the initial sate of particle is different.Am I right?I want to mean, in three different case three different particle size range, due to change of multiplication factor? Or, is there any other meaning?Or this is the limitations of REFD.

Thanks Bruno and also to Villard, for co-operation.

Regards,
Mohammad Nurul Islam

"REFD" is : RE, then FD.

RE : the radius of each sphere is modified
FD : friction coefficient is reduced, leading to a volumetris collapse, 
but this time radii are not affected : the stress is controlled using walls.

So, three different cases will give the same particle size distribution 
(because the final size is fixed at the transition between RE and FD), 
but different porosities and different total volumes of the sample.

Hi, please use yade-users at lists.launchpad.net for questions, since
others may be interested, too.
> I?m familiar with C and learning C++, but I saw that scripting in python would be better.
> How can I start a Python Yade console and make a script running?
>   
If you run yade from terminal and it is compiled with features=python,
you will get python console. That way you can start experiments. Note
that specifically for STL importer, there is a big demo in
examples/rod_penetration. To run script, you can pass it as an argument
to yade:
 
 yade-trunk scripts/simple-scene.py

for example. Get back should you have further questions.

If i build the version 1.12.1 it works all perfectly.

What is the error?

you need to install boost serialization package.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] warning: offensive bool value `64'
	encountered	(interpreted as true).
Message-ID: <884cdea788e59adff12d9ca8f6e2d1e3@arcig.cz>



 Hello,  

  if you ever get the message in subject, it is a bug in yade and
should be reported to https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/. Search your
saved simulation file for "64" (or whatever number you happen to see)
and send us the attribute name having this value.   

 @devs: it took me a while find the cause, but after adding a bool
flag, I experienced much more of those messages. It turns out that if
bool is not _initialized_ properly, only the lowest bit is used
(normally if it is never assigned to at all). The garbage in higher
bits appear if it serialized in stream. Later I found a thread on this
(http://bytes.com/groups/c/165173-uninitialized-bool). The cure is to
put the bool data member in initializers. I will fix
SpheresContactGeometry::initContactOnPositiveFacetSide in svn soon,
once I am not beind proxy.  

 Regards, Vaclav

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Applying constant force on a wall
Message-ID: <20090129152646.7922.77118.launchpad@potassium.ubuntu.com>

Hello,

I made a wall using utils.box, I would like to add a constant force
acting on that wall but if I use DeusExMachina ForceEngine on that box
with subscribedbody boxId it does nothing.
Box dynamic is set to True, I dont understant why.
If I use a Displacement or TranslationEngine it works, but I need that
wall not to move unsopped cause it will compenetrate an imported
geometry.
I would like to make a uniaxial compression test like simulation, with
an imported geometry on the other side.
Is that something I'm doing in wrong way?

Thank you

Hi, I think that what you do is correct. Can you provide the simulation
script? Isn't the force too small (or timestep too small) so that you never
see the displacement? For uniaxial compression test, I would recomment
using UnaxialStrainer (of which I can send you examples, screenshot is
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/ScriptUniaxialTensionCompressionTest), if you
want strain-controlled test; it is suitable for sphere packings. For
stress-control, you are on your own probably. Vaclav

Ah, now it everything clear. The ForceEngine must be _before_
NewtonsDampedLaw (or PhysicalActionApplier), since forces are reset at
the beginning of every step. Therefore, the engine sets the force, but
it is immediately reset without being used.

HTH, Vaclav

PS. Instead of PhysicalActionDamper, PhysicalActionApplier and
PhysicalParametersMetaEngine, use NewtonsDampedLaw. It is functionally
the same, but faster, since it does less loops.

out of curiosity - did you make any benchmark to confirm this?
See how much faster?

Hello,

I followed the advices that Mr Vaclav gave me and the code is below, but
my box is still falling with spheres, there is again something wrong? It
seems that only gravity is affecting bodyes.
Another point is that if I activate the snapshot engine it results in
blank images, there's a reason or a wrong setting?

Thank you

Is not the force you use too small, given dimensions and mass of the box?
Try something much larger and you will see.

Well, SnapshotEngine seems to work depending on the graphics card you have.
In any case, the 3d view window must be in foreground.

If you want something that work reliably, save simulation state (positions
and colors only) to database and then run it through player,
scripts/simple-scene-player.py show how to do that.

For the last line, you can skip 'qglviewerState.xml' parameter and say
instead startWait=True. It will wait until you set the scene view with
mouse, then press backspace and it starts. Again, keep the window in
foreground.

Another, perhaps simpler options, is to use some desktop-recording app,
like http://live.gnome.org/Istanbul or
http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php, which are also packaged
for some linux distributions.

HTH, Vaclav

Hello, it is always nice to see people considering using Yade.
Please send your questions to Yade mailing list instead of private 
emails to me, so the best person (depending on the question) will give 
answers.

> - My first question: dose it includes a facility to make it possible to consider the 
> aggregate shapes? For instance such that is provided by some softwares like PFC. As

>   
Yes, clumps have been implemented in Yade to simulate agregates of spheres.

> - Is yade capable to employ a digital processed image as an input to generate the

>   
Nothing for 2D (how can you generate a 3D model on the basis of 2D 
images?!). However Janek Kozicki developped tools to turn the results of 
3D tomography into Yade samples.

None that I know of.

Yade is coded in c++, Python is used for the command line interface.
You need to code in c++ if you want to develop new features, otherwise 
python can be enough to create and run simulations.

We are working on it, but I don't think it is fully functional yet.

"Magnificient" is a minimum here. ;-)

You need to be more precise in describing your problems.

What means "it does nothing"?
How did you check it?
Is the force on the wall equal to 0, or is it just equal to something 
independant on your applied force?
Is it not moving at all/moving slowly so you don't realise?
etc.

I did not use the force engine before but the problem should be easy to 
find, putting a few "cerr" or "LOG_DEBUG" here and there, with tests 
based on the wall's id.

Also, I have the feeling (but I'm not sure...) that what you want may be 
keeping the force constant on the wall, instead of adding a constant 
force on it. These are two different approaches.
In the first case, you need something in the line of 
TriaxialStressController, with isDynamic=false; in the later case, 
ForceEngine is ok, with isDynamic=true.

Yes, I did a benchmark. It is "significantly" faster.
But I don't remember the numbers now... :-P

I'll try to read replies first, next time, to avoid replying when Mr. 
Va?lav already did.

Again Marco, you need to be more precise when commenting what happens in 
the simulations.
By doing so, you will find the cause of most problems on your own, actually.

Why is the box falling? What is the total force on it? Is it an upward 
force? So you discovered a terrible bug in Yade.
Is it a downward force? So there is nothing wrong here, you need to look 
elsewhere.

About this :

"if you
want strain-controlled test; it is suitable for sphere packings. For
stress-control, you are on your own probably. Vaclav"

I think Mohammad Islam is working on this at the moment and should be 
quite advanced on this point (just browse the mailing list archives). So 
you are perhaps not totally alone on the matter.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] About the easiest method to obtain

Message-ID: <07200ABDA779AA41BD5747E1FE9E0A09A2A29C@kstud7.utk.tennessee.edu>

Hi, all:

I need to write a small routine so that the contact force of each particle can be checked from which I would like to accurately judge its value, if the contact force of one particle is (or close) zero, I should mark it as "quick" condition, suppose all particles are in the fluid. Which list should I look into? The ElasticContactLaw seems to loop over the contact but not for each particle.

Thanks in advance!

the sum of all forces acting on each body is stored in physical actions / bex

With a few caveats, though: they are nut supported by NewtonsDampedLaw
and they are not wrapped from python. I can do the latter if it is
needed, it is quite simple. The former would however require a consent
on the order of clump/clumped bodies in BodyContainer

Hmm, by accident I was just composing a call for developers on that few
days ago. Let me post it here, then:

Yade is not able to run parallel computation, even though all papers
mention that DEM, as an explicit method, parallelizes very well. While
processors have more cores, but the speed doesn't increase much,
supporting computation on multiple cores is becoming critical. We have
quad-cores now, there will be 6/8 cores in a year or so, Intel is
working on 96-core Larrabee platform, there is new standard (finally)
OpenCL for running computations on graphics cards that have easily over
500 stream processors, there are Cell processors with 6 (32 in the
future) vector computation units. Yade is going to lose the game if this
trend is not caught up with.

A decent implementation of parallelism in Yade is an effort adequate for
a PhD. Up to now, there has only been isolated efforts (lock-free
containers, ParallelEngine), but only as as part-time jobs to scratch an
itch; someone devoted to this for a few years is needed. I think it is
maybe 30% physics, the rest being quite low-level (and interesting)
software engineering effort.

If you (anyone) are in position to take PhD students, please consider
this as something of big importance for Yade future. I believe I am
speaking for other developers here.

Vaclav

Thanks Janek, is this similar to :ncb->physicalActions->find(idUnbal,actionForce->getClassIndex()).get())->force ??
However this gives the total force (unbalanced force), what I need is only the contact force, is there any way to extract that?
Thanks again for your help.

Hi, Janek

I looked at the paper:

J. Kozicki, F.V. Donz? ?YADE-OPEN DEM: an open-source software using a discrete element method to simulate granular material?. Engineering Computations, (accepted for publication) 2008 

I think Figure 12 (b), or Figure 11 (b)- "distribution of forces" is enough to solve my problem, must I upgrade to the latest SVN to plot that? Sorry I am still using yade.0.11.1 :-P

oh, that's just forces for each interaction. You can look on
interactions to get a contact force.

I thought that you need total force on each grain.

Message-ID: <4986A98F.1040705@univ-nantes.fr>

Hi everyone,

   I upgraded last week my version of Yade from Yade-0.12rc1 to Yade-0.12.1.

 From now the primary view (or second view...) stay empty or 
transparent: I can see trought the primary window the desktop for 
instance; whereas it was working nice with Yade-0.12rc1. (I use 
Intrepid, with desktop KDE or Gnome, the problem is the same)

Have you got any idea to solve this problem? (I am totally incompetent 
for this kink of purely computer problem!)

   Best,

    Luc

Janek worked out some GL-initialization stuff recently, maybe it would
help if you upgrade to svn... Maybe he knows better how to solve this.

If I understand correctly, you need the same loop as for computing 
unbalancedForce, don't you?
You can check the code, it's something like :

loop on bodies
{
    ...
    f += Forces[body]
    ...    
}

Please check if your graphics card is OK, type this:

  glxinfo | grep render

and you should get answer which contains text "direct rendering: Yes"
Maybe you will need to install package "mesa-utils" for this.

Then please start `glxgears` and you should see a basic 3D graphics
with rotating gears.

If both work, then I'm puzzled why 3d display in yade is broken. You
can try to upgrade to latest version from SVN, but I think that
0.12.1 was ok in this matter...

I think that you can try to reinstall packages with
restricted modules for your current kernel version.

maybe you need to disable compiz, or another composite manager. Check
your desktop settings. I remember that Bruno had to disable
this for yade.

Hi,

miniWm3 is our local reduced version of Wm3 providing Vector3 and
Quaternion. Could you please run 

 rm -rf /home/luc/Desktop/build-0.12.1  ## delete all intermediate files
 /home/luc/Desktop/YADE/lib/yade-0.12.1 ## delete installed plugins
 scons useMiniWm3=True pretty=0 >build.log  2>&1

then wait until it finishes and send your build.log if there is still some
problem? 

Regards, Vaclav

Wm3 is used for any maths in Yade, EXCEPT for triangulation, where CGAL 
is used.

in fact I'm using delaunay triangulation from wildmagic, in lattice
model. But Bruno is using CGAL for voronoi tesselation :)

But wm3 is used for ALL mathematics in yade. Vector3r and
Quaternionr are from Wm3.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Be carefull with "normalize"
Message-ID: <4989C83B.60607@hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello

Be aware that if you use the "normalize" function from wm3, it might 
give the result (0,0,0) if the norm of the vector is smaller than a 
"tolerance" value.
It sounds very strange to me, as I see no reason for this check, and I 
was wondering if it could not cause problems in some cases, when a 
"normalized" vector has length 0...
Janek had this problem when defining the normal of some triangular 
facets (of small size) by normalizing the cross product of edges vectors.
I prefer not to be the only one thinking about this potential problem, 
which probably needs a fix.

A few ideas from a discussion with Janek :
1- possibly fix minWm3 so that the test vs. tolerance is removed
2- display a warning to the user when the tolerance is hit and the 
vector is "rounded" to (0,0,0)
3-  run batch tests with/without the tolerance test

Bruno

Hi,

  Is the "normalize" function from wm3 used currently in Yade? I mean 
not in specific packages your are developing at the present time but in 
some basic and usual computation made in Yade.
I think for instance to the computation of the normal vector defining 
the intergranular contact plane (for the DEM), or something else. If yes 
it could a real problem...

Bruno have you got an idea of the default value of the "tolerance" 
value?  The reason for this check could be to avoid a division by zero 
or "something" to close to zero.

Luc

see: 

lib/miniWm3/Wm3Vector3.inl line 301

lib/miniWm3/Wm3Math.cpp line 29:

  template<> const double Math<double>::ZERO_TOLERANCE = 1e-20;


In my snow grains simulation I'm dealing with really small triangles,
because the base unit is meter. And the snow grain average diameter is
0.001m and the size of triangles that form a polyhedron representing
the whole grain is about 0.000001m (but smaller are possible).

I was calculating normals for those triangles (it's necessary for
collision detection between polyhedrons), and suddenly some triangles
were disappearing. Finally I've found the reason - the length of
cross product was less than 1e-20, for example: 1.221342351454256e-21
(we have 16 digits of precision with double).

This function Normalize() is used everywhere in yade. But I don't know where :)
We could try 'grep Normalize ./* -R' to see where it is used.
For example I don't see it in ElasticContactLaw.

If someone is making simulations with spheres smaller than... I don't
know, maybe 0.00001m then maybe he has a problem...

Vectors in Yade are vectors from wm3, and - if I'm not wrong - 
"normalize" is a member of this class.
So yes, unless you find an exception, any "normalize" in Yade is the one 
i was speaking about.
I know how you feel...

Well... there is no reason to avoid division by zero, and even less 
reasons to return a null vector instead of (1,0,0) or something like this.
If a division by zero makes the program crash, so should do the 
normalization of a null vector. But this is still not the problem here : 
vectors are not null at all, they are just "something small" with 
respect to what the developper of wm3 considered "small", arbitrarily.
In my understanding of number representations (someone will correct me 
perhaps), there is no less precision when computing the norm of (2e-20, 
1e-20, 0) compared to the norm of (2e+20, 1e+20, 0). That is why this 
tolerance makes no sense.

Think to it as a matter of units, like in previous Janek mail. If one 
wants to define the simulation with lengths in gigakilometers, and get 
coordinates in the range 10e-30 - 10e-32, no "tolerance" should prevent it.

Hi Luc, I am doing alright :-)

For your problem, you are using quite new scons (post-1.0, I think). I
fixed that hopefully in SVN, to get your change to .12.1, edit
pkg/common/SConscript, and change lines approx 25-27 like this:

    env.SharedLibrary('BodyRedirectionVector',[],LIBS=[]),
    env.SharedLibrary('InteractionVecSet',[],LIBS=[]),
    env.SharedLibrary('PhysicalActionVectorVector',[],LIBS=[]),

(add the LIBS=[] after each of them).

The reason is that new scons thinks that empty files are plain c (not
c++), links with gcc (not g++), but doesn't add some paths to other libs
that are normally needed. Since these plugins are just empty, you can
safely declare it needs no libs and your error should be gone.

That is true. On the other hand, you want to balance the inherent
numerical imprecision from limited number of binary positions for the
number representation. The proper way is to define a "characteristic
length" for your simulation, by which you always scale some _relative_
tolerance. (Obviously adds some multiplications, but not much.)

Wm3 was conceived for graphics and games, therefore it can rightfully
suppose that 1e-8 (or 1e-20, which is value I changed it to about half
year ago) is probably close enough to zero.

If we just remove any tolerance checks, we would get a few infinities,
but that shouldn't hurt. In some cases, however, this is not desirable,
like computing Quaternion from (0,0,1) to (0,0,-1), IIRC.

Hi,

This bug concerns also the release 0.12.1 that one can download as a

Let's just set it to zero. And either:

1. put a std::cerr warning when a division by zero is detected or
2. remove the check altogether, let it divide by zero and crash.

I prefer 2nd option. Much safer.


Units have nothing to do with that.

Hi yade developers,

Here is just an interrogation about the xml files defining the Yade 
simulations:

Two things:

1/ With 10000 particles the xml files are about 40Mb, it is already a 
little heavy. With 100000 particles it would be about 400Gb and I 
imagine it is quite difficult to open such a file, to edit the first 
twenty line to define the simulation.

2/ In my mind, the definition of the particle assembly with its 
interactions and the definition of the simulation are two different 
stuffs. For instance you can perform different simulations from a same 
particle assembly, thus you don't need for each of these different 
simulations a different xml file defining the same initial particle 
assembly with the same initial interactions.
Or reciprocaly you can perform an identical simulation from different 
particles assemblies...

Consequently, my interrogation is:

Would it be interesting to split the xml file into two parts:
1/ the very first part defining the simulation itself could be kept as 
an xml file that we can edit manually,
2/ the second and heavy part could be saved separately as a compressed 
xml file or a binary file or something else ...

But, maybe you will tell me that it is not a problem thanks to python 
;-) in every case it is only a question, what is your opinion?

Save simulations to .xml.bz2, it is much smaller (no extra work for you,
except the longer extension), yade handles that transparently. Some text
editors (at least gvim does) let you edit bz2-compressed files also
transparently, without having to decompress them by hand.

You anticipated right :-). I personally have the simulation defined in
python, but I load spheres assemblies from text files
(utils.spheresFromFiles, there is some function in c++, but I don't
remember). That way I can run the same tension-compression test on
different assemblies. And use the same assembly for different simulations.
Those files describe really just the position and readius, not
interactions.

If you load a .xml in python, you can however consequently modify engines,
for example, and keep the same body and interaction parameters as you saved
them.

The extras for python are that it can, for example, run tension, then
compression, then save the plot to some file and exit. You can read
different parameters from text files, then running 40 jobs with different
parameters overnight and compare results etc (see
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/ScriptParametricStudy for a very simple example)

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Python scripting for create links,
 change player config and model scale question
Message-ID: <20090207152030.16918.87659.launchpad@palladium.canonical.com>

Hello

        I have a lot of questions for you:

The thesis I'm working on is about improving the design of the debris
transport of a driller,the better way to simulate this in my opinion is
with DEM where i can see the particle dynamics.

I set up a simulation and the first question is:

The mean radius of the debris is about 0.0004 m, in this case the
critical timestep is 10^-6 and with many particles it takes too much
time to have a one or two minutes simulation, in Your opinion could I
use a scaled model to have a bigger radius ad a bigger timestep, how
should I modify set up parameters like Gravity, should I leave 9.81
cause the mass is auto calculated from dimensions?
Of course all the force in action would be very much larger loosing the
adherence to reality and some potential useful informations, from the
point of view of particle motion, this scaling would change the final
result, in the sense that i would like to see how particles moves to
improve design.

I read a lot of posts of the mailing list but I have not found anything
about commanding the Yade player with Python, for example i saved a
simulation in SQLite, but the clipping plane make scene cut, How can I
change clipping plane?

How can I set particle links with python script, there is a function
that at a certain level of force breack the links?

Thank you very much for your time

I am not sure if I understand what are you going to scale. If you will
simulate only smaller part of the problem, you don't really scale
anything, just use smaller domain. You can have more rough particles and
see if you get realistic results. You will never have 1 minute
simulation, just forget that, with 10^-6 timestep (unless you have 10
particles or something).

I've been working with (and smaller) .3mm particles now. To quickly
guess the simulation time, you can use this formula:

 number_of_particles*number_of_timesteps*computer_constant=computation
time [s]

where computer_constant is time/particle_and_timestep, given that number
of interactions scales roughly with number of particles. The
computer_constant is, in my case, about 3e-5 (2.4GHz Opteron), so you
get the idea how much you can simulate. For 1 minute simulation of 1e3
particles with 1e-6 timestep (i.e. 6e7 steps) you get 21 days.

See gui/qt3/GLViewer.hpp, it has a comment at the beginning that
explains the keystrokes. F1,F2,F3 to select the plane, space to
(de)activate it, Escape to return to scene manipulation.

During the simulation, this is done by the constitutive law, which is
written in c++ (since it is very computationally intensive; in can be,
in principle, in Python, but it would be too slow to be usable). There
is quite a few of them, depending on the material you need. Some of them
have friction, cohesion, ..., etc, others can comment better on that. If
you have special law for your case, your best bet is to write a new
constitutive law from scratch. Have a look at ElasticContactLaw2 for a
quite simple example.

This is a research topic in itself, if you ask. Personnaly, I don't know 
how to scale the model adequately for debris transport problems, and I 
suspect nobody knows...

As Va?lav replied already : it would be enough to choose (or write) a 
contact law with a tensile strenght. Then all you need is to set the 
tensile strength value using Python interface.
Be carefull about "links" if you think "permanent links". The "link" 
concept is being removed from Yade slowly, we only have "interactions" now.

As Bruno said, there is probably no direct response about the 
possibility to use a scaled model for your problem of debris transport.
In my opinion, simulate one or two minutes of real time with DEM is quit 
a lot (1 min with a timestep of 1e-6 s means 60 million of iterations, 
with 10000 particles is a lot!). But, there are solutions. For instance 
the problem is the same in soil-mechanics when we simulate laboratory 
tests. The duration of a real test can be several minutes, or a few 
hours.... But we can show, from a numerical point a view, that in 
specific conditions we can numerically accelerate the simulation of the 
laboratory test in order to simulate only few seconds of real time.

Good luck!

Well, I understand that at the present time, for the DEM, if we use 
particles with a size not too small (for instance 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001) 
there should not be problem.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Monitoring of tangential stress ?
Message-ID: <49906B3E.9030709@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello everybody.
Short question : Considering a box containing my numerical sample I'ld 
want to monitor the tangential stress acting on one plate of the box and 
I wonder if someone has already made it ?

Less short question : In fact I want even monitor this tangential stress 
("tau") depending on the normal one ("sigma") : so that the ratio 
dtau/dsigma remains constant (to a given value) during the simulation, 
whereas an other control parameter would be, for example, something like 
a strain rate. Would you have something to say about it ??
Thanks

Jerome

Hi, there is utils.sumBexForces for mutliple bodies to get sum of forces
on those.

If it is just one body that is of interest for you, you use engine like

 StandAloneEngine('PeriodicPythonRunner',{'iterPeriod':1000,'command':'print
O.actions.f(plateId)'})

in your simulation (O.actions.f(id) means force from physicalActions on
body #id).

Hi Jerome,

I did something like that but I am not sure to be able to help you.

It was with SDEC, I was able for instance to control the ratio between 
the stress deviator q=sigma_1 - sigma_3 and the volumetric strain 
epsilon_v. You can find the details in my thesis.

I think that all the elements are already, more or less, written in Yade 
  to be able to do such a control. Indeed, with the 
"TriaxialStressController" engine you can impose a given normal stress 
component to be equal to a given value. In your case, this value is not 
a constant but is proportionnal to a tangential stress for instance (or 
reciproquely).

The tricky point when you define such simulation is the following: 
depending on the mechanical response of the granular assembly and 
depending on the value of the ratio of the two stress or strain 
components you want to monitor, the numerical loop used to control the 
stress on a wall can become instable. To limit this effect I introduced 
a kind of damping parameter (such as the damping wall parameter defined 
in the triaxialcompressionengine), but I don't think it is a clean 
solution in this case because you don't really know what is the 
influence of a such damping parameter on the simulated response...

   Good luck

    Luc

Thanks for your answers.
- Vaclav : if I understand well the command you indicate allow me only 
to follow the evolution of the tangential stress, not to act on  it ? 
(and I want to act on it, but maybe my english wasn't clear enough...)

- Luc : I saw it in your thesis, yes. That seems to be of high interest 
for me, with the difference that you were acting on normal components 
whereas I will also focus on tangential one...

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Triaxial statetransition and code
	submission
Message-ID: <499182CC.1090605@univ-nantes.fr>

Hi,

I will be a little bit boring...

Question about submission of code to svn:

I modified 2 or 3 lines in TriaxialCompressionEngine in order to update 
the friction angle from compactionFrictionDeg to FrictionDeg when the 
state transition is performed manually (by editing the .xml file) from 
Iso_compaction to Triax_loading. (but I am not sure to respect the idea 
of the person who written this part of the code)

In addition, during the state transition, I would like to update the 
tangent of friction angle for all interaction and not only "real" 
interaction
(from a discussion between Jerome and Bruno I understood that the 
transition (isReal = 0 and isNew = 0) => (isReal = 1 and isNew = 0) will 
not happen, but I would prefer to have several "protections" than only one).

My question: I may want to submit code modifications in opposition with 
previous developments. Thus, what is the philosophy? submit directly 
these modifications to svn, or via a yade developer who will filter the 
modifications?

   Best,

    Luc

It makes sense. I will review your changes when you will have them 
committed.

Why?!
By design, interactions which are not "real" have really no reason to be 
considered. See them as if they don't even exist. They will be seen as 
"new" interactions if, by any chance, they become real again. So, they 
will be re-initialized anyway, and your updated values will be 
overwritten before they can be actually used.
Did you try it already? I suspect it would lead to some i->friction = x 
with i the null pointer, then Yade crash.

Sticking with the current design rule is the best way to avoid problems 
if you ask me. If this transition from (0,0) to (1,0) could occure, it 
would be a major bug, and a correct value of friction would not help a 
lot (think about the tangential displacement, which would be totally 
wrong : current_position - position_when_the_contact_was_lost).

Personnaly, I'd prefer people to at least point it out when they modify 
some code that I'm developping/using (Triaxial and related classes). 
Exactly like you just did. The commit itself can (should) be done by the 
one who modified the code (you).

To summarize :
1/ For changing friction after manual editing - or any other change 
consistent with current philosophy : let you commit your change.
2/ For accessing unreal values, it is really not consistent with the 
current contact logic. If you really want this behaviour, or anything 
else in opposition with previous logic, it is better to create your own 
separate class.

An important point when you modify an existing class : your changes must 
keep the default behaviour unchanged (might sound obvious).
One usual way for this is :

class C {

+ bool newFeatureActivation;
}

in the constructor : newFeatureActivation = false, and then define the 
modified behaviour in a if (newFeatureActivation) { ... }.

This precaution is not needed for your friction update though, as it is 
already doing nothing by default.

Ok your are right, I forgotten this point: for some of these non real 
interactions "variable" friction does not exist. Well, I am just 
perturbated to see sometimes in xml files wrong friction values even if 
they correspond to non real interaction. But, ok, that is not a problem.

	in pithon
Message-ID: <20090218172056.4424.61891.launchpad@gandwana.canonical.com>

Hallo, what code I have to use if I want to try
ConstitutiveLawDispatcher in python.
I've got other 2 questions: setting Young modulus low to 10^3 what
implies, it act on Kn right? That forces are transimmed softly?
If I saved a simulation in a sqlite dbase can I use filters in
postprocessing with player or should I include them before starting a
simulation, how can I do that?

Thank you very much, you are very helpful to me due to lack of
documentation and I'm sorry to bother you so much.

Marco

Yes.
If you use my definition of Kn (i.e. "SimpleElasticRelationship"), Kn is 
proportional to (Young modulus x diameter). That way, you get a constant 
macro-stiffness for a packing whatever the particle size.

	last changes
Message-ID: <20090223150412.32549.71348.launchpad@palladium.canonical.com>

Hello,

I would ask if TranslationEngine and RotationEngine gives translation
and rotation on the base of m/s and rad/s or m/iteration and
rad/iteration.
If I put a translation velocity of 0.001 m/s If i have a 10^-4 timestep
with 5 iter/sec should see almost no movement cause it should transate 1
mm every 10^4 iterations,but I see great translations every iteration.

On the light of new interesting changes, could someone update the
Dynamic_simulation_tests examples to explain what has to be changed in
python scripts in order to take advantage of the new revision?

Thank you very much

Marco.

I'm sure that Vaclav will fix it very quick.

Message-ID: <20090225193604.26318.7681.launchpad@potassium.ubuntu.com>

Hello.

If you want to find some documentation you could start with reading the
thesis that you find here: http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Publications
If you want to create a simulation I suggest to use Python scripting, I
am a new user too and find this way a lot easyer than writing it in C++.
If you want to use the console you have to build Yade with Python like
this:
scons -j2 PREFIX=home/user/YADE optimize=1 feature=python openmpi=1

Once compiled you have to open the terminal, go to the bin directory
like /YADE/bin/ and write ./yade-svnVersion NameOfScript.py

You can find some script examples in Script folder and Examples folder,
you have to copy to bin directory and then execute them.

To apply different forces at determined moment you could use
PeriodicRunnerEngine.

Unfortunately I cannot say much about Yade because I'm only a user,
anyway you could explore all the sources and try to ask to these
gentleman developers.

Bye

Marco.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Launchpad: important changes to your
	PPA
Message-ID: <20090129065606.9001F168D2C@mail.berlios.de>

Hello yade-users,

Your Launchpad PPA: three important changes
--------------------------------------------

We have three important items of news regarding your Launchpad 
Personal Package Archive(s):

 * your PPA now has its own key and packages are now signed
 * your PPA URLs and upload paths are going to change
 * we are going to start removing deleted/superseded packages 
   from our servers.
   
These changes affect PPAs owned both by individuals and teams.


Signed PPAs
------------

Every PPA now has its own unique key, which Launchpad uses to 
sign the packages it builds in the archive.

People downloading a package from your PPA can now verify that it
hasn't been altered since Launchpad built it.

You can find out how to add the PPA key to your Ubuntu system 
here:

https://help.launchpad.net/PPAKeys


Changes to PPA URLs and upload paths
-------------------------------------

We want to make Launchpad flexible enough that an individual or
team can have more than one PPA. To allow for that, we need to
make some changes now.

With the release of Launchpad 2.2.1 (due on the 28th January), 
three things happen:

 * your PPA's upload path will change from ~user/ubuntu[/series] 
   to ~user/ppa/ubuntu[/series]
 * your PPA's overview page URL will change from 
   launchpad.net/~user/+archive to launchpad.net/~user/+archive/ppa
 * your archive's address will change from ppa.lp.net/user/ubuntu
   to ppa.lp.net/user/ppa/ubuntu
   
To make sure everyone has a chance to get used to these changes,
there'll be a period where both the old and new URLs/paths work,
after which we'll remove the old versions. However, you should let
your PPA's users know about the archive address change as soon as
possible.


Automatic removal of deleted and superseded PPA packages
----------------------------------------------------------

Until now, when you've deleted a package from your PPA -- or a
newer package has superseded it -- Launchpad has kept a copy of
the binary and made it available from your PPA overview page.

>From now on, whenever you delete a package, or it is superseded,
Launchpad will:

 1. mark the package as deleted/superseded
 2. wait 30 days
 3. entirely remove the binary package from the PPA servers.

You'll still have access to the build records, the only
difference being that there'll no longer be a link to the binary.

Important: after the release of Launchpad 2.2.1, on January 28th,
we will start removing any packages that have been in the deleted
or superseded state for more than 30 days.

If you have any questions about these changes, please ask!

Thanks,

FilterEngine and ColorizedVelocityFilter is my answer on question about how to assign a color to bodies velocity when doing postprocess simulation results. In order to get a worked filters save simulation results (for example, with SQLiteRecorder),
after which load its with SimulationPlayer and add to engines list the desired filters (now it may be ColorizedVelocityFilter or ColorizedLayerFilter or you own). For example from python console do:

o=Omega()
colorized_velocity = DeusExMachina('ColorizedVelocityFilter',{'autoScale':False,'minValue':0,'maxValue':1})
o.engines = o.engines +[colorized_velocity]

After this, click on refresh button in the SimulationPlayer filters tab and check "Allow filtration". After this filters will be recognized among another engines to a filter list and  will be setup FilterEngine::isFiltrationAllowed=true. Now after loading each frame will be doing: for each filter in the filter list do filter->action() if filter->isActivated(), how it is occurs for engines during simulation. To activate/deactivate certain filter setup isFilterActivated key, for example

colorized_velocity['isFilterActivated']=False

ColorizedVelocityFilter calculate mean velocity of a body on last time interval and assign a color with this body from the color scale.
ColorizedLayerEngine assign a desired color with bodies, who lies in certain layer.

It is all the more curious because, if I understand, Wm3 is used only for
Delaunay triangulation, no?

Is anybody can help me please?

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Launchpad: your PPA's size limit
Message-ID: <20090212124758.043EC30CC3@mail.berlios.de>

Hello yade-users,

Personal Package Archive size limits
-------------------------------------

We've been thrilled by the take-up of Personal Package Archives and the
different uses to which people are putting them. As the number of PPAs
grows, naturally they require more and more disk space.

Right now, the default size of a PPA is 1GB but Launchpad doesn't 
enforce that. Instead, when you get close to 1GB in your archive 
Launchpad warns you by email.

We're plannning to start enforcing PPA size limits as of the 25th of
February. From then onwards, Launchpad will reject further uploads to
PPAs that have reached their maximum size. Note that this applies to a 
very small number of PPAs; the majority of PPAs are much smaller than 
1GB.

The limit isn't a hard rule, though. I've already been in touch with 
everyone whose PPA is getting close to or is already over 1GB. If I 
haven't contacted you but you need more space for your PPA, please 
request it using Launchpad Answers:

https://answers.launchpad.net/soyuz

If you use your PPA in a way that helps the community or is cool for 
some other reason, we'll almost certainly increase its size.

If you have any questions or concerns about this change, get in touch
with us on the launchpad-users mailing list:

https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-users

Thanks,

 With the player. Run the player, load a results dbase, print in console:
 
 f=utils.ColorizedVelocityFilter()
 (this function is defined in gui/py/utils.py)
 
 then, check "Allow filtration" and click the refresh button on the Filters tab. 
 Then, click on play and all dynamic bodies will be colorized with their velocity magnitude.

Hello,

I have reviewed the archive of posts and found some past entries saying
that documentation for yade was in progress.  Do you know where I can
find any documentation, complete or incomplete, that would help me
develop my own model?  I have already compiled yade and familiarized
myself with the basic user interface.  A list of yade functions and what
each one does would be very helpful.  Usually, do you develop a
simulation by directly creating a .xml file or by creating .cpp and .hpp
files in C++?

Also, do you know if it is possible to feed a time-series of forces
applied to different particles instead of a constant force?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

ForceEngine was not updated to use BexContainer yet, it is fixed in the
last commit, r1692. If you still have the same problem, paste the
backtrace, that's the easiest way to find what caused the exception to
be thrown.

You can block DOFs on per-body basis using something like this:

for b in boxid:
   b.phys.blockedDOFs=['x','y','rz'] # to block x,y translations and z
rotation

It will also be  faster, I think: you will eliminate engines.

That would be pretty slow to be used for every iteration. If you have a
time-series that can be linearly interpolated, one could write something
like InterpolatingForceEngine (there already is
InterpolatingSpiralEngine), which is quite fast then.

> scons -j2 PREFIX=home/user/YADE optimize=1 feature=python openmpi=1
I'd rather suggest something like:

  scons profile=opt features=python openmp=1

You can also add version=trunk to have the lastest without changing the
name of exectuable and recompiling everything at every svn up.
Profile=opt selects the 'opt' profile, which turns on optimization,
disabled debugging and a few more things.

HTH, V.

Hello,
I?m switching my simulation form ElasticContactLaw to Sphere
viscoelastic contact law.
In my simulation I have a box that push up the spheres but with new
contact law it crashes, maybe because box contact are not implemented?
There is a way to apply a force at the base with this law?

If I want to see if some particles pass trough a point, can I make a box
and check if there are spheres interacting touching it without make them
interacting?

Thanks you a lot!

Why wrong? If I take the translational velocity divided by the radius, 
it gives 20/1e-3 = 2e4 rad/s, the same order of magnitude as 5e3 rad /s. 
So I'd say it is consistent (imagine the mobile particle has to roll on 
the other one with this initial velocity, a fraction of the initial 
momentum is converted into rotational momentum, that is why 5e3 is lower 
than 2e4).

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Problem with dispatcher and
	simulation
Message-ID: <20090306003116.1080.31699.launchpad@potassium.ubuntu.com>

Hello, I'm trying to use the interactionDispatcher but i have this
warning:

Traceback (most recent call last):

I have problem also cause speres compenetrate and pass the stl imported
facets.
Could you give me some advice?
How can I modify my script to use openMPI?

Thank you so much

Marco

Hi,

   I understand that to commit code to repository, I need to have a 
read/write access from subversion.

To download a subversion with read/write access I have to use ssh 
protocol, for instance:

svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk

 From my university, access outside the university with ssh is totally 
locked.
Hence my questions are:

1/ Do I really need to perform a checkout with svn and read/write access 
for then be able to submit code?

2/ If the answer is yes for question 1/, is there a way to perform a 
checkout with read/write access without using ssh?

   Thanks for your help

Luc

I guess that you have your network misconfigured, and that
you are using proxy for http. I've seen similar problems in 3s,
before.

Please ask your network administrator to verify that
your /etc/network/interfaces (and /etc/resolv.conf) files are
correct. 

ssh access should not be locked, really - it is possible but extremely
unlikely, especially at the university. You need to ask admin about that.

Hi Janek,

Thank you Janek for your help.

   Yes I am behind a proxy, but I don't think it is a problem of 
configuration network (my network works well for svn, synaptic, 
thunderbird, matlab licence manager, and so on).

I have already asked my administration about that, and it is clear ssh 
is not authorized.

Luc

I see, please try this:

   svn checkout http+svn://svn.berlios.de:80/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk

Let me know if it works, and if you can commit with this checkout.
And if yes - then please add this to wiki webpage (just click "edit"
to edit the webpage).

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] pregenerated sphere packings
Message-ID: <49B8EA75.2060509@arcig.cz>

Hi,

I would like to have pregenerated (periodic) packing of spheres which 
could be used to fill arbitrary volumes just by putting one cell next to 
another and then clip the result to get the exact shape. I use constant 
sphere radius. How would you generate such packing? I imagine like 10k 
spheres. Would it be useful for other people to have it in yade as text 
file and some utilities to use it?

I know yade cannot do it at the moment, but perhaps PFC can?

Vincent is working with JF Jerier on filling a volume with spheres.
The volume is a mesh exported from gmsh or netgen. Or maybe is just
described as triangular faces?

You got to ask them, because Vincent has demonstrated last
month that it already works in yade. But maybe is not finished.

Yes PFC can, if you pay the additional bill for the periodic boundaries 
option... I don't know anybody with this version in Grenoble.
Appart from this, it is a good idea and yes it could probably be used by 
more than one guy. All we need is to code the periodic boundaries in 
Yade (I have ideas for this but no time...), or find somebody with a 
periodic code.

Hi,

 I know somebody with a periodic code. It is Christophe Martin (Professor
at University of Grenoble, laboratory SIMAP), He has developed Dp3d in
Fortran. Normally, this code is free.
If you are interesting, I can send him an email in order to know how to
download his code.

It should work.
This law is relatively general. You have to tune it to choose between 
fragile or perfectly plastic behaviour (the first would be better for 
rocks, the second seems more realistic for soft soils), and also decide 
if contacts created during the deformation will be cohesive or not.
It can include bending/torsional effects too, but those components will 
be only elastic for now. It is no big deal to add a plasticity  threshold.
If you need a cohesive law, I recommend using this law as a basis and 
adapt it to your specific needs instead of starting a new class.

Hi Vaclav,

   The making of the initial assembly of particles in DEM is an 
important and often time consumming step. So I don't think I can help 
you, but I think that a such process of generation of packings of 
particles should very interesting and usefull.

    Best,

   Luc

Message-ID: <49BFBB4A.5020608@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hi everybody. I didn't find anything that works neither on the site nor 
on archives so I afford me to ask here this simple question : what 
should I type to exclude some pkgs from compilation.
I tried for example to type in a file scons.profile-MyTrunkC (attached) :
exclude = ['lattice','snow','fem','realtime-rigidbody']
but it seems to be a syntax error :

jduriez at r0calcul1:~/MyTrunkC$ scons profile=MyTrunkC
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
@@@ Using profile MyTrunkC (scons.profile-MyTrunkC) @@@

scons: *** Error converting option: exclude
Invalid value(s) for option: lattice snow fem realtime-rigidbody
File "/home/3S-LAB/jduriez/MyTrunkC/SConstruct", line 146, in <module>

Thanks

It seems to be a problem with snow : this one suggested didn't work :

jduriez at r0calcul1:~/MyTrunkC$ scons profile=MyTrunkC
scons: Reading SConscript files ...                
@@@ Using profile MyTrunkC (scons.profile-MyTrunkC) @@@

scons: *** Error converting option: exclude
Invalid value(s) for option: snow         
File "/home/3S-LAB/jduriez/MyTrunkC/SConstruct", line 146, in <module>

But with
exclude = 'lattice,fem,realtime-rigidbody'
(in profile file) it currently compiles.

Thank for your answer !

So you have an older version of yade, without snow in it. If you want to commit your work, you need to:

1. 'svn up' (and you will have snow then, and Vaclav's multithreading improvements, and so on)
2. make sure that it compiles
3. commit ;)

How do you have your data given? If it is a time-series, you will 
probably have to interpolate, since otherwise the simulation would 
depend on the time step. Does the force change at every step? And so on. 
For some scenarios, it can be better (from the performance perspective) 
to do it in c++, for other it is simpler in python. Then we will be able 
to determine the best way to do it.

If the force is different at every step (and every particle), the best 
would be to create a DeusExMachina engine that would at each iteration 
generate normally distributed force and apply it. The only parameters of 
the engine would be subscribedBodies and some parameters of the 
distribution. I am not sure what is what you get from the reading every 
.5-3 secs.

If you need help with the implementation, let me know. A question of 15 
minutes.

Yes, either from python (which could in turn read it from text file) or
read from text file within the c++ code if the series is very large
(like 1e6 numbers; this is not limitation of python, but of the current
way of passing values from python to yade objects).

As said, for the interpolation, there is no problem, the
linearInterpolate function interpolates efficiently in an ordered manner
on time-values sequences, which is what you need.

How many different values do you need for each step? Do you apply one
interpolated force (to a single or multiple particles) per step?
InterpolatingSpiralEngine::applyCondition sets the interpolated value
and then calls engine that already exists to apply it; it is only this
thin wrapper that has to be written. If the interpolated quantity has
more components (like 3d force), multiple value sequences will be used
with on time sequence.

Did I get it right? Vaclav

You can try in python first and then see if it is fast enough. One of
your engines will be 


StandAloneEngine('PeriodicPythonRunner',{'iterPeriod':1,'command':'applyForces()'})

(note that this engine must be before NewtonsDampedLaw) and you do all
the rest in applyForces that you define somewhere before you call
O.run():

def applyForces():
	bex=BexContainer()
	for b in O.bodies:
		f=... # your stuff
		bex.addForce(b.id,f)


To see the performance impact, go
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Speed_profiling_using_TimingInfo_and_TimingDeltas_classes ; basically you say O.timingEnabled=True before running the simulation and

 import yade.timing
 timing.stats()

when finished.

----

For InterpolatingSpiralEngine, the syntax is like this:

velocities=[10.1,10.2,10.7,9.1,8.2,7.5,6.1] # velocities
times=[0.1,.3,.4,.6,.8,1.0,1.2] # t at which the velocities were measures
assert(len(velocities)==len(times))
subscribers=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
O.engines=[
 #...
 DeusExMachina('InterpolatingSpiralEngine',{'times':times,'angularVelocities':velocities,'wrap':True,'slope':thrAxRad,'subscribedBodies':subscribers,'axisPt':[0,0,0],'axis':[0,0,-1],'label':'driver'}),
 #...
]

In your case, you would have to pass to your hypothetical engine a list
of readings for each body, probably as list of lists (but that is not
supported at this moment from python to yade, unless you play dirty
tricks that I can show you), and the time points. Reading the data from
file to memory at the point of engine construction would be another
option.

Hi, I have once tried compiling YADE on cluster, but I stopped half way also because of boost, what is your OS on cluster? can you tell your administrator to update your boost? then I think it will be fine, otherwise I guess we should have a local copy of boost, and tell SCONS to find the boost in your local path, did any one have such experience? I think Janek is running YADE on cluster?

I was installing yade on RHEL4 cluster recently. I compiled boost (and 
also python, but that is perhaps not necessary if your version is 
something like 2.4 or later) locally (using the compilation howto on 
their website) and adding LIBPATH=... and CPPPATH=... args to scons. 
Additionally, I had to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=local/lib/directory so 
that the libs would be found at startup.

If you need more help, let me know.

V.

Oh, my fault. You should say O.actions to get a BexContainer object, 
which then accepts addForce etc methods. Make sure you run at least 
r1727 where I added the addForce method.

DeusExMachina("InterpolatingSpiralEngine") works fine here. Can you post 
your code (whole script preferrably).

Have a look at InterpolatingSpiralEngine header, in 
pkg/common/Engine/DeusExMachina/RotationEngine.hpp, all parameters are 
commented. thrAxRad is a leftover variable, it should be some number, 
simply. I hope it is clearer now.

Can you run yade -h? It will give list of compilation options at the 
end. If it contains BEX_CONTAINER, then it is OK. If not, however, I 
added addF to the old ActionContainer so that you can use it as well now 
(you need r1731 at least for that)... I hope it will compile, I cannot 
test now... Let me know.

I would like to convert all engines to BexContainer soon, as it is much 
faster a allows for parallelization, but it is not crucial at this moment.

Regards, Vaclav

Do it just like you would in python:

forces,times=[],[]
for line in 
file('your.text.file.with.2.numbers.per.line.separated.by.whitespace')
     if len(line.split())<2: continue # skip empty lines
     f,t=[float(s) for s in line.split()]
     forces.append(f)
     times.append(t)

def applyForce():
     # find index of the time we are at or just after now in the series
     # this is quite suboptimal, since it traverses the array every time
     i=0;
     while times[i]<O.time: i+=1
     # and use force at that index
     f=force[i]

well, you have to apply the force after f=force[i] in applyForce(), like
we had that before! Something like

for id in bodiesIWantToApplyForceTo:
	O.actions.addF(id,f)

I meant it as an example of interpolating engine. Of course it serves
you for nothing as you don't need spiral motion. As said, once you're
clear about what you need, no problem to write an engine LIKE that for
your case.

xlC_r is probably plain c compiler, whereas you would theoretically need 
c++ compiler. Besides that, and more importantly, yade will not compile 
anything else than g++; you will probably have to install that one as 
well. You can do it from sources, but it is involved. Better if you ask 
the admin to install that for you.

http://www.perzl.org/aix/index.php?n=Main.Gcc can help you. Another 
problem can be binary compatibility of c++ libs between gcc and the AIX 
compiler, but you will see if that works or not.

Sorry for bad news, get back if you need more (help, not bad news ;-) )

Vaclav

Can you send your script over? I think that could be just that too small
is applied or it changes very fast, so that you visually don't see any
movement.

It is not an engine, just a function that does the interpolation (ok,
admittedly it shouldn't be in DeusExMachina directory...). There is no
such thing as DeusExMachina('LinearInterpolate',...), what would it
interpolate (force? rotation? mass?).

Checkout r1741 from svn, and see scripts/test/interpolating-force.py and
run it. It should give you an idea.

I created InterpolatingDirectedForceEngine based on the assumption that
the direction of the force doesn't change (whence "Directed" in the
name), I hope I got right what you needed.

Hi Janek,

   Sorry it doesn't work, here is the result (in french sorry):

luc at pc-calc-ls:~$ svn checkout 
http+svn://svn.berlios.de:80/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk 
/home/luc/Sim_DEM/YADE_svn/5mars09/trunk
svn: Le serveur a envoye une valeur inattendue (400 Bad Request) en 
reponse a  larequete OPTIONS pour

Do you think that we can commit code directly trought berlios web site, 
it would a solution to avoid ssh?

   Best

Hi Janek,

It seems, I can checkout svn version with read/write access with the 
following command:

svn checkout https://developername at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk

I will keep you updated if I can commit (I have not tried yet) like this.

Best,

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Modification in
	TriaxialStressController
Message-ID: <49D630BF.5090101@univ-nantes.fr>

Hi Bruno, Hi everybody

   I just commit a new engine to perform "true" triaxial simulations 
with different stress or strainrate values in each space direction.

To do that, I have slightly modified the TriaxialStressController by 
adding variables sigma1, sigma2 and sigma3 (generalization of sigma_iso) 
and variables max_vel1, max_vel2 and max_vel3 (generalization of max_vel).

TriaxialCompressionEngine should work even with this new variables.

I hope I have broken nothing, if there is a problem let me know!

  Best

  Luc

Interaction where isReal==false has no associated interactionGeometry 
and interactionPhysics. You could try modify those, but yade will segfault.

If you want to change friction angle for all future interactions, you 
have to adjust frictionAngle that is stored in physicalParameters of 
individual bodies and that is used to compute frictionAngle of 
interaction by InteractionPhysicsMetaEngine.

Message-ID: <20090405165054.1606.44691.launchpad@gandwana.canonical.com>

Hello

After conpiling the boost 1.38 library witch updated g++ compiler and
setting Yade like this:

export QTDIR="/opt/freeware/qt" QTINC="/opt/freeware/qt/include" \
 QTLIB="/opt/freeware/qt/lib"

scons \
        PREFIX=/opt/yade \

        QTDIR=/opt/freeware/qt \
        SHCCFLAGS="-lbz2 -lz" \
        LINKFLAGS="-lbz2 -lz" \
        SHLINKFLAGS="-lbz2 -lz" \
        CXX="g++ -lbz2 -lz -lboost_system" \
        jobs=2 \
        version=aix \
        variant='-power5' \
        exclude=gui,qt3,log4cxx,snow \
        features=python \
        optimize=1 \
        openmp=1 \
;

many of the initial check are passed:

Checking whether c++ compiler "g++ -lbz2 -lz -lboost_system"
works...yes
Checking for pthread_exit(NULL) in C library pthread... yes
Checking for glutGetModifiers() in C library glut... yes

But the exclude parameter seen not to work as it wants log4cxx and gui
libraries

ListOption('features','Optional features that are turned
on','python,log4cxx',names=['python','log4cxx','binfmt','dummy']),

Compiling QT libraries is a bit difficult

When copiling Yade there are a lot of warnings cause SHCCFLAGS,
LINKFLAGS, SHLINKFLAGS, LDFLAGS are not used in the linking phase of
compilator and so there is the need of using "g++ -lz -lb2
-lboost_system"

How could I proceed ?

Thank you very much.

We are a bit inconsistent here; say "scons features=python" to not use 
log4cxx but add qt3 to excludes to not build qt3-dependent files.

For the linker flags, I will have a look.

Glad you got over the initial troubles :-)

I don't uderstand very much what is wrong:

setting Yade like this without qt libraries that are not compiled but

OK, it seems that your python installation is weird... can you run this
in the shell, please

python -c 'import distutils.sysconfig,pprint; pprint.pprint(distutils.sysconfig.get_config_vars())' > /tmp/somefile

and send the /tmp/somefile as attachment?

In r1746, we handle empty LIBS now, but I am not sure whether other
distutils attributes can be affected as well. Maybe it will fix your
problem and maybe not.

HTH, Vaclav

Hi everyone,

Could somebody tell me if the CohesiveFrictionalLaw is ready to use? And is there any validation as well as benchmark for that contact law? It looks in the development stage for me but it can be very useful to simulate some cohesive materials such as clays.

Regards,

Kien Dang

Message-ID: <20090319030153.11913.74017.launchpad@potassium.ubuntu.com>

On a previous post, it was recommended that I use PeriodicRunnerEngine
to apply a time series of forces to particles.  Could you instruct me on
how to implement this engine in python?  Or, if you have a better way to
implement such a time series, please let me know.  However it would not
be feasible to interpolate the data.

Thank you,

Thank you for your quick reply.

Yes, the force is different at each time step.  The time step between
each force reading varies from about 0.5 seconds to 3 seconds.  The
forces do no follow a trend over time, but they are normally
distributed.  Please let me know if you need any other information about
the data.  I appreciate your assistance.

I have consulted with a colleague, we do not think that generating
normally distributed forces would work well for this application.  Also,
I found that we have another data set that is linearly interpreted with
a constant time step of about 4ms.  The forces applied on each particle
should different at a given time step.  Could this time series be
directly fed into yade?

Thank you,

There will be about 50 dynamic particles in the simulation, and at each
time step, each particle should have a different force from the times
series applied to it.  There is only one component of the force.  I have
been working only with python so far, and I would prefer to use it
instead of C++.  What is the maximum number of data points that could be
used with python?

It would be helpful if you could tell me the syntax for using the
InterpolatingSpiralEngine in python.

Thank you again for your help

I added the periodicpythonrunner to my code, but I am not sure how to
define BexContainter().  When I run the simulation, it gives the error:
"NameError: global name 'BexContainer' is not defined".

Also, when I use the interpolatingspiralengine in my code, it gives the
error: "RuntimeError: ClassFactory::create - cannot create class named:
InterpolatingSpiralEngine".  Additionally, with the interpolating spiral
engine, I am not sure what velocities you are referring to.  Should
these instead be the same forces I apply in periodicpythonrunner?  Also,
I do not know what 'thrAxRad' should be in that engine.

I know I have a lot of questions, but I greatly appreciate your help.

Thank you,

Roger

Yes, I would be glad for you to add my script to the example scripts once I
get it working.  I hope others will be able to learn from it.

I realized that I do not have r1727.  I was able to download revision r1730,
but I do not think it is working, because when I run the simulation I still
get: "'ActionContainer' object has no attribute 'addF' ".  I am new to
open-source code, as well as yade, so I am not sure if I am doing this
correctly.

Thanks,
Roger

I would like to go ahead and update to the current revision (r1732 I think)
so I can be sure I have everything I need.  What procedure should I follow
to accomplish this?

Thanks,
Roger

I would also like to read my times series of forces from a file. Is  
there a python function that will accomplish. In the script examples I  
saw multi.py that is supposed to read some values from a file, but it  
didn't read from the file when I ran the simulation. I was wondering  
how to use this function (or another one) properly to obtain forces  
from file.

Thank you for all your help.

Roger

Using the method above, yade will read my force data from file, but it will
not apply it to the particles.  (I know that it is reading the force data
properly because I have it print the force data from the file).  I do not
get an error when I run the simulation, but the particles do not move.  I
have tried larger magnitudes of forces to be sure that the particles would
move if exposed to the applied force.  Also, I am now running revision 1732.

Second, when I use InterpolatingSpiralEngine, I get the following error:
"RuntimeError: Number sequence argument required."  The arguements for this
engine include an angular velocity time series, but I have no knowledge of
this data.  Therefore I do not understand why I need this engine.  Perhaps I
should use a different interpolating engine?

Thank you for your continuing help.

Roger

Ok, now I can read the force data from file, and I believe it is applying
the forces to the particles (it now does not give me an error when I run the
simulation but the particles do not move).  Based on my understanding of the
program, they do not move because I now need an interpolating engine to
interpolate between each point to make integration possible.

I looked at the LinearInterpolate.hpp file in
trunk/pkg/common/Engine/DeusExMachina
but I did not see a LinearInterpolate.cpp file.  I think this engine would
serve my purposes, but I can't get python to recognize it.  (I tried calling
DeusExMachina('LinearInterpolate',....).  Can python currently run the
engine?

If it cannot, do I need to write a new interpolating engine?  I imagine this
would be written in C++, so could you give me some guidance on how to
accomplish this if it is necessary?

Thank you,
Roger

You are right, the direction of force does not change.
InterpolatingDirectedForceEngine looks like it will work perfectly for my
application!  I greatly appreciate you writing this new engine for my
application.  I have not yet tested and implemented it in my script because
I still need to compile the new version r1742.

Below is my current script which you requested:

o=Omega()

o.initializers=[

    StandAloneEngine('PhysicalActionContainerInitializer'),


MetaEngine('BoundingVolumeMetaEngine',[EngineUnit('InteractingSphere2AABB'),EngineUnit('InteractingBox2AABB'),EngineUnit('MetaInteractingGeometry2AABB')])

#    bex=o.actions
#    for b in o.bodies:
#        ff=(0,0,f[o.iter%len(f)]) ## x,y components zero, z component is
taken from f based on iteration number wrapped to the length of f
#        bex.addF(b.id,ff)


forces,times=[],[]
for line in file('rogerscene2.table'):
    if len(line.split())<2: continue # skip empty lines
    f,t=[float(s) for s in line.split()]
    forces.append(f)
    times.append(t)
print forces,times

b=o.bodies
def applyForces():
    # find index of the time we are at or just after now in the series
    # this is quite suboptimal, since it traverses the array every time
    i=0;
    while times[i]<o.time:i+=1
    # and use force at that index
    f=forces[i]
    ff=(0,0,f)
    bex=o.actions
    for b in o.bodies:
        bex.addF(b.id,ff)

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Sheltering Implementation (force
	reduction based on	relative position)
Message-ID: <20090411181702.14658.33216.launchpad@potassium.ubuntu.com>

I am looking for a way to reduce the force applied to a particle based
on its position relative to other particles.  I am using python
scripting for my code, and I do not know how to reference a particle's
position or velocity in python.  Is there an engine already in Yade that
could accomplish a force reduction based on relative particle positions?
If not, do you know how I could create one in python or C++?  I am
currently using the InterpolatingDirectedForceEngine to apply a time
series of force magnitudes (read from text file) to particles.

Thank you,
Roger

A particle position can be found like O.bodies[4].phys.pos (which is
actually a shorthand for O.bodies[4].phys['se3'][0:3]), and I think you
already know how to apply force. The best would be to add this to you
own engine that would derive from InterpolatingDirectedForceEngine. I am
not sure what is the exact algorithm that you need.

Janek's lattice model is only for concrete and is suitable only for 
tension, IIRC. So no, you need your own model for that; if you know c++, 
it should be fairly straightforward (but not necessarily easy). Vaclav

Hello All!

I need to simulate mining rocks with possibility its destruction.
Can YADE lattice model be suitable for that? I can code C++ so I can add my
code.

Thank you

not exactly. lattice works with compression, but has one limitation
I never came around to fix - it doesn't have collision detection with
itself. Once something breaks into two halves, they can overlap if
they move onto each other. But I didn't need to fix this for my
calculations, because the deformations were so small, that if
something breaks - it doesn't move more than the crack size.

concrete is a fake rock, lattice will work for rock fracturing,
subject to collisions limitation. Adding collisions is possible by
enveloping a lattice mesh into a polyhedron and use collision
detection between polyhedrons. A bit of work, though.

Lattice can not do dynamics, though. No impacts, etc. Only
quasi-static simulations.

Ok, thank you for information! I have to think about it for making decision.


My task is to simulate rocks with destruction possibility.

Actually I have started my own program for that, but it is 2D model. So know
I should migrate to 3D, using my program or something another.

What is your opinion, is it really difficult to learn YADE for adding new
modules?

Not trivial, but if you have the model ready mathematically, it should
be quite straightforward.

Spherical particles are what is relatively well implemented, if you need
that, basically you can just create a class with your formulas that
compute forces from displacements. For simulation scanrios, you can
create those from python quite easily, or from c++ as well.

HTH, Vaclav

I guess that the difficulty in adding new modules is roughly equal to
the difficulty in understanding the "MyTetrahedron" example.

Find all the files that contain "MyTetrahedron", eg. with this command:

  grep MyTetrahedron -l --include="*.hpp" --include="*.cpp" ./* -R

And read the comments inside. Look at the Publications on our website too.

MyTetrahedron is adding whole new body geometry along with collisions 
etc. Isn't that a bit too much just for new material model? It is rather 
ElasticContactLaw or ElasticContactLaw2 that should be looked at as example.

In se3 are respectively stored : the three coordinates of the center of 
the body, then the four members of the quaternion accounting for its 
orientation. But in my version of Yade (quite not up to date...) I never 
saw letters.

Serialization of the Se3r class is defined in
lib/serialization/KnownFundamentalsHandler.tpp:735. First 3 numbers are
position, other 4 are the orientation expressed as axis (3d unit vector)
and angle (scalar). (The se3 data member belongs to PhysicalParameters)

Thank you all for the help!

I have already "researched" it, changing different parameters.
Guess, will have more questions soon :)

Hello all!

I have a quaternion question.
I have two of them:
  Q1 (0, 0, 1, PI/4) (around axis OZ)
  Q1 (0, 1, 0, PI/6) (around axis OY)
My box should be rotated using first quaternion, and the a second one. It is
a new topic for me. Can anybody advice me, what should I do to solve this
task?

You can product them:
if M - first rotation and Q - second rotation, then final rotation R is
R = Q*M = (q0+q)*(m0+m) = q0 m0 - q Dot m + q0 m + m0 q + q Cross m,
where q and m is the vector part of quaternions; q0 and m0 is the its
scalar part.

I don't know if there is quaternion product from python in YADE
(Vaclav?), but from c++ it is simply as:

Quaternion3r Q,M,R;
R = Q*M;

ps. Also you can see formulas and references in Appendix of my PhD
thesis (in russian): http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/714488/DorofeenkoPhD.pdf

Thank you, Sergei!

I have also tried this way but with no success. Maybe I do not completely
understand quaternions.
I have attached the small XML file, what I generate. Yellow boxes are ok,
but blue ones needs to be rotated a little bit around its long axis.

Could you not give me an advice?

(Currently) Quaternions are converted to plain 4-list of floats
(axis,angle) if requested from python, no special type.

If want to play with Quaternions in python, I recommend very simple
euclid module: http://partiallydisassembled.net/euclid.html

Vaclav

Anton, I have attached modified scene.xml, which I have get from your
scene.xml
with Vaclav's euclid.py (Vaclav, thanks!) and typing the follow commands
in YADE console:

from euclid import *
O.load('scene.xml')

q1 = Quaternion.new_rotate_axis(pi/6, Vector3(0,1,0)) # rotate about Y
on pi/6 angles
q2 = Quaternion.new_rotate_axis(pi/2, Vector3(0,0,1)) # rotate about Z
on pi/2 angles

# now, YADE's se3 is [X,Y,Z, Ax,Ay,Az, a]
# where X,Y,Z is the body's position;
# Ax,Ay,Az is the rotation axis,
# a is the rotation angle.
# So, we...
o1 = q1.get_angle_axis() # get angle and axis for the first blue box
(rotation about Y)
o2 = (q2*q1).get_angle_axis() # get angle and axis for the second blue
box (first rotation about Y, after this rotation aboud Z)
# Then, we set the parameters,
O.bodies[1].phys['se3'] = [0,0,0, o1[1][0], o1[1][1], o1[1][2], o1[0]]
O.bodies[3].phys['se3'] = [0,0,0, o2[1][0], o2[1][1], o2[1][2], o2[0]]

THANK YOU ALL for the help!
It helped me a lot, I've found my mistake. Your advices helped me to create
such objects:
http://geom.com.ua/s1.png
http://geom.com.ua/s2.png

After that I'm getting "quaternion expert" :)

Actually I used another library
http://www.sacredsoftware.net/tutorials/Tutorials.xhtml for creating
quaternion. Also I would recommend this tutorials for understanding this
complicated topic. Maybe it is a good idea to add this link to wiki?

Thanks again

Hello all!
I am playing with YADE, and sometimes when I start simulation no motions I

Especially, when I generate "Rotating cube" example, it happens often.
What can it be?

Change the simestep by hand to something like 1e-2. I will put it to the
code also.

RotatingBox crashed here and I had to remove lines

rootBody->transientInteractions=shared_ptr<InteractionContainer>(new
InteractionVecSet);
rootBody->bodies=shared_ptr<BodyContainer>(new BodyRedirectionVector);

from RotatingBox::generate() to fix it. I will commit this shortly.

Thank you, V?clav, for the quick help!

A several weeks ago I wrote about choosing the software for my tasks
simulation.
So it seems, I will use YADE for that. As less till the end of this year.
Then we'll analyze result and make final decision.
I hope I will be able to understand how YADE works and will try to develop
YADE project as well.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Can boxes interact ?
Message-ID: <4A0BE7D2.9090808@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello everybody.
    A small question just for curiosity : can boxes in Yade interact ??
    I understand how spheres interact, how one box and one sphere 
interact but I do not think that something is written so that boxes 
interact (eg I do not see anything like 
InteractingBox2InteractingBox4....ContactGeometry) ?
    I do not need that boxes interact, it is just to be sure.

Thanks

Jerome

yes, that's too small timestep.

Why VecSet is crashing and only VecMap is working?

That's right, there is no interaction between boxes defined. Just in the 
ErrorTolerant contact law (RotatingBox) but I am not sure how accurate 
that algorithm is.

Thanks for the answer. A still curiosity question about the same topic 
(consequently, I didn't break the thread) :
- in InteractingBox2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry, the choice 
is made to set for the box a value of radius (which will be used to 
compute rigidities) equal to 2 times the radius of the in-contact sphere.
Is there a reason to choose this "2" ??

I think that is SDEC heritage and I had a discussion on this (with Bruno
IIRC) once; there is no real reason for this particular value.
Personally, I wouldn't use boxes in my simulations, since we have Facets
which are much more general, at least for non-dynamic
bodies/surfaces/whatever.

openMP needs linear-index access to the container. VecSet doesn't
reimplement the virtual operator[](unsigned int) which just throws in
the generic implementation.

I propose to delete VecSet, since using VecMap speeds up simulations by
about 30% compared to VecSet (that' why it is not the default any more)
and it will never work with parallel code.

V.

Hi All!
I have done small changes in one of the python scripts. May I make commit
this changes? If yes, what is a normal procedure for that?
In attachment you can find diff file.

Thank you

Janek will give you write access to the repository and you will be able
to commit (see svn instruction on the wiki). For this one, I will apply
the patch to my local copy and commit it the next time (it can take a
while, though, because of bigger changes being done). Vaclav

Ok, thank you.

Actually, I have not found an accurate instructions according to writing
style of YADE: what indents, how to write brackets, what is the maximal
string length etc.
Where can I get it?

Right here :-) Tabs to indent, otherwise no instructions.  Everybody
would tell you about his/her own taste so there is no policy. (I prefer
spartan spacing, few linebreaks and longer lines as I have 24" panel,
for that matter).

Apart from this makeup style: IMPORTANT!! Always keep in mind that other
people will read your code: make sure you write comments and that
purpose of every class is clearly documented, preferrably both in the
header file and by providing a sample script on how to use it, for
example. The doxygen-style comments for all class members are also
desirable. If you are developing a bigger set of classes that cooperate
in some way, create a wiki page on that particular setup (like
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Speed_profiling_using_TimingInfo_and_TimingDeltas_classes) and put reference to the wiki page into sources or elsewhere.

Welcome on board.

Vaclav

Thank you for explanation.

But I think it would be good to have exact rules on style. Code must be in
order. Maybe, it is good to create some rules for new added code?

Message-ID: <930069bf0905220111u64707f35lbcbad0dd47e9742@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All!

I have a physical schema, which is here http://geom.com.ua/schema.png
(200Kb)
This is the peaces of mining rocks, which needs to be destructed.

I would like to know your opinion according implementation this schema in
YADE.
Is it a good idea to use the lattice model, placing in the middle of nodes
spheres?

Thank you ahead

I would just use DEM spheres for everything (IMHO what distinguishes
lattice models from DEM is that they have not collision detection for
nodes and most the time also no inertia within nodes).

You will have 2 different constitutive laws, one between spheres within
one cluster, which will be cohesive, and another one (or the same one
with a bool isCohesive or something like that) for the interactions of
spheres from 2 different clusters.

HTH, Vaclav

I think I will solve my task by your supposed way.

In attachment there is the diff-file. I'v added 1 function. Hope it will be
useful.
I would like also to ask to inspect the code. Is it suitable, or corrections
are needed?
How often do you usually commit the code?

Thank you

You write like a c-guy :-) I wrote it in a more python way (lists,
lists, tuples, etc), in particular using the numpy.arange function to
create list of values. Find it in r1774, utils.regularSphereOrthoPack
and scripts/test/regular-sphere-pack.py.
> How often do you usually commit the code?
Depends, not so often if I make bigger changes as to not break anything
for others; to make the commit a logical whole.

examples to write new function.

All keyword parameters that are not specified in the def(...) argument 
list will end up in the **kw dictionary, which is passed as-is to 
utils.sphere. Therefore, you can use those as usually.

I've just returned from a conference and still quite busy. Vaclav
(and Bruno), you both have access permissions to add people to the
project. You can do it faster than me. Otherwise you will have to
wait a bit..

You can of course, but you also have to use constitutive law that uses 
ClosestFeatures. Make sure that you read code of 
InteractingBox2InteractingBox, but the code is quite hairy and I 
wouldn't trust it as-is: as far as I remember I found myself (sorry) 
fixing bugs in Olivier's code quite often; I wasn't at yade crew back 
then but it seems to me that the point was to prove how flexible yade is 
(or can be) by implementing many algorithms, but without necessarily 
scrutinizing them for their correctness.

Besides, you have to use FrictionLessContactLaw, which takes only 
penetration depth of bodies into account; therefore you gen no shear, 
for instance.

Yet another point may be the speed of box collisions; maybe replacing 
box by a few clumped spheres would be good enough for your purposes.

HTH, Vaclav

I'm sorry, I have played with different syntax, but still problems with
adding velocity to these particles.
How can I Add, for example, velocity?

temp_vel = {'velocity': [0,-1,0]}
O.bodies.append(utils.regularSphereOrthoPack([0,0,4],extents=2,radius=.1,gap=.1,color=(0,1,0)))

Thank you very much,

PS Sorry, for novice questions

Dont look for complexities where there are none ;-)

O.bodies.append(utils.regularSphereOrthoPack([0,0,4],extents=2,radius=.1,gap=.1,color=(0,1,0),velocity=[0,-1,0])

Message-ID: <930069bf0905270637v1f158380yf2e6b36a673bb2dc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All!

I want to install the operation system on a computer, which will work with
Yade mostly for simulation.
Are there any reason to install 64-bit operation system (actually it will be
Ubuntu 9.04) or 32-bit is ok also?
Processor is Pentium E5200.

Thank you.

IMHO there is no reason to have 32bit system on a 64-bit machine. On 32 
bits, 1 process cannot use more than 4GB of RAM.

Vaclav is right. The questions, which concern only the personal taste  
and do not affect the accuracy or clarity of the code, have no place  
in a standard programming. There is no difference in readability  
between:

void myFunction() { // ... }

and

void myFunction()
{
   // ...
}

Nevertheless, this task (indentation, position of brackets...) can be  
done automatically (for example with bcpp). So it is not important.

I think that the critical point is the naming convention. This  
convention, without being too prescriptive, should exist (in fact  
there are several in Yade!). In practice, each programmer is  
responsible for his choice. For example: _if (face[i].belongBoundary) 
_ and _if (bound[i] == 1)_ are quite similar but the second needs  
explanation while the first is self-documented. Finally, the most  
important is the design...

Vincent

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] about the interaction between boxes
Message-ID: <20090526004003.26352.38777.launchpad@gandwana.canonical.com>

hello, everyone, i am a new user of YADE. I noticed that somebody have
already asked some question about the the interaction between boxes, and
the answer is " there is no interaction between boxes defined. Just in
the ErrorTolerant contact law (RotatingBox) but I am not sure how
accurate that algorithm is."

so if I still want to do some simulation about boxes interaction, can i
write the codes as RotatingBox?
do i just need to add the following contents in my codes?

        shared_ptr<InteractionGeometryMetaEngine>
interactionGeometryDispatcher(new InteractionGeometryMetaEngine);
interactionGeometryDispatcher->add("InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4ClosestFeatures");
interactionGeometryDispatcher->add("InteractingBox2InteractingSphere4ClosestFeatures");
interactionGeometryDispatcher->add("InteractingBox2InteractingBox4ClosestFeatures");

thank you very much!

What's the problem there? The new clump collides with the other clump
getting some rotational motion, then different spheres hit the ground at
different points which makes its trajectory bend towards the side of
contact, as there is shear. Did I miss something?

At the beginning they have no motion at all. Gravity, since it is
uniform, gives translational motion. At impact, it causes rotation of
the clump. There is nothing wrong with that, it is just sum of kinetic
energy that should be preserved and one can transform in another.

If you take a stick and let it fall, then if one of the ends touches
ground the first, the still will get rotational motion. I just tried
with a pen on table and it is true ;-)

There is a new function for utils. Would like you to ask to check and commit
it.  I know, that you dont like this style, but I was trying to do it by
your way with no success: difficult to get indexes of Z-axis array.

Thank you

Hi, I found a better approach for this type of problems: separately
define function that generates the grid within given part of space and
separately have function that clips the resulting grid to the exact
solid shape ("predicate", because it tells whether a point is inside or
outside). For example:

from yade import pack
pack.regularHexa(pack.inSphere((0,0,4),2),radius=.1,gap=0)

will return list of spheres of radius .1 hexagonaly arranged (without
gaps) within spherical domain centered at 0,0,4 and with radius 2.

I am sorry that it will probably break your older code, but it seems
just so much more elegant and extensible.

If you want to define new shape that you want to fill with spheres (e.g.
an ellipsoid), you only have to define a new ellipsoid predicate and
pass it to the pack.regularOrtho / pack.regularHexa functions. They ask
the predicate for its bounding box, generate orthogonal/hexagonal grid
and return sphere at points of the grid where the predicate was true
(i.e. points inside the solid).

If you want to define new packing type (e.g. orthogonal in plane but
planes moved at every layer to make it denser; or even irregular
packing, e.g. from a periodic packing that you have ready somewhere),
you can use already existing predicates with the new one.

For packing, we have ortho/hexa now, for predicates, there is sphere,
axis-aligned box and non-aligned cylinder. It is demonstrated in
scripts/test/regular-sphere-pack.py.

Best, Vaclav

Thank you very much, Vaclav for that suggestions and realization! Sure it
will be very helpful!
Later I will add some more shapes.

I have attached the patch, which adds euclid module to the Yade. Please,
commit it.

I would like to add ellipsoid, but what is the best way to test it during
code writing. How can I compile just _packPredicates.cpp?

Sorry for simple questions.

Run "scons pretty=0", then copy the compilation & installation command
to the terminal.

Alternatively, run
scons /usr/local/lib/yade-trunk-opt/py/yade/_packPredicates.so (put your
own path) to ask for just that target to be compiled & installed.

Seems OK here:

In [4]: yade.pack.inSphere((2,0,0),1).aabb()
Out[4]: ((1.0, -1.0, -1.0), (3.0, 1.0, 1.0))

In [6]: yade.pack.inAlignedBox((0,0,0),(2,2,2)).aabb()
Out[6]: ((0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 2.0, 2.0))

(PS you can post to yade-dev instead of yade-users for this kind of
things, perhaps?)

Hi, Ripudaman:
 
According to your description, this model should be easily be modeled by YADE, you can look at one of my previous publication:
 
Feng Chen, Eric. C. Drumm, Georges Guiochon, 3D DEM Analysis Of Graded Rock Fill Sinkhole Repair: Particle Size Effects On The Probability Of Stability, 2009 Transportation Research Board Conference 
 
I can email you a pdf if you cannot find it.

Hi,
 
I am working on a specific project and I need to know if I can make a hole of specific dimensions at the bottom of a box such that grains (spheres) can flow out under the application of stresses etc? 
 
I can proceed with YADE only if this is possible. Thank you.

Hi all!

I have some thoughts on YADE documentation.

I am working with YADE not so much time. But the main thing, what waste a
lot of time, is the insufficient documentation. I'm sure it stops a lot of
new potential users and (probably) developers.

So my guess is, that it would be good to start from creating short but
informative instructions or howtos for different tasks. It should include
short description how to do it and good examples with comments. I like style
which has been used for C++ tutorial http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/

I am ready to write some of such documents, but my YADE knowledges are yet
not so deep.

I think it is an important to have a good and easy-understandable
documentation.

Hi,
Preparation of YADE documentation will be a good step for new users.I have some own documentation that I have prepared with respect to PFC and OVAL and some other open source DEM code, manual. And I guess other YADE users also have such types of documentation.If we share each others documentations, it will enrich YADE resource.

Ofcourse there are some documentation on YADE, but for new users it is questionable, how much it will be helpful !!!

Mohammad Nurul Islam

Hi all!

I have some thoughts on YADE documentation.

I am working with YADE not so much time. But the main thing, what waste a lot of time, is the insufficient documentation. I'm sure it stops a lot of new potential users and (probably) developers.

I think if we have as more documents as possible will be positive for new
users. We can start from creating pages on wiki and then we'll see how it is
better to structure in one document.

I would like to know what is the main difference between Box and Facet
geometry? And what is better and more reliable?
What is better interaction model Box-Sphere or Facet-Sphere?
I appreciate any comments.

Thank you.

Boxes suck, sphere-box interaction is modeled as contact with fictive
sphere. For anything that is beyond simple elasticity, use Facets. You
can also make arbitrary triangulated surfaces with facets (especially
with GTS which I am integrating right now), which is not possible with
boxes. 

OTOH, Facets have no mass, therefore cannot be dynamic (they can move,
but not as a result of impacts etc).

Vaclav

This mail didn't get through due to technical issues at launchpad today.
I post it just for completeness. Thanks for your effors, let's hope
there will be something coming from that :-)

===

Thanks for your proposition. I would prefer to have some content ready
before designing. There has been too much designing (in yade) of things
that never see the light or world (like new class names, coding
conventions, fem models) in yade and I am a bit suspicious about that.
Are there some obstacles for people adding pages now? Likewise, we have
bug tracker at launchpad, how many people use it?

I started (a few months ago) to create some pages that show how to do
this or that in python (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/ScriptParametricStudy
or http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/PythonPlotting ). Janek pointed me once to
sawfish wiki, where they have nice scripts section
http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Scripts - something like that could be
useful.

I think Vaclav's example articles it is comparably what we need.
Such small instructions-example are very good for learning.

We dont need a lot of explanations in articles as people who are using YADE
(or plan to do it)
are mostly PHD-students or engineers and they can understand short
instructions.

It is necessary to include links where reader can get more information on
current topic.
Links can be to internet-pages or (and) to YADE source code.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Yade crashes from vertical facets
Message-ID: <930069bf0906250101l4e672a6p6c069cc1d68f4e19@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all!

I have that YADE crashes because of 1 string in my script.

CODE:
#_______________________________________________________________________
a = 62
b = 40
h = 33
boxThick = 3
boxCoef = 5
a = 0.001*a
b = 0.001*b
h = 0.001*h

#Side 1
O.bodies.append(utils.facet([(a/2*boxCoef,b/2*boxCoef,0),(a/2*boxCoef,-b/2*boxCoef,0),(a/2*boxCoef,-b/2*boxCoef,boxThick*boxCoef)],dynamic=False,color=[0.98,0.984,0.576]))
#_______________________________________________________________________

The process crashes after last string.
But when I change:
...
O.bodies.append(utils.facet([(a/2*boxCoef,b/2*boxCoef,0),(a/2*boxCoef,-b/2*boxCoef,0)..........................
...

to
...
O.bodies.append(utils.facet([(a/2*boxCoef,b/2*boxCoef,0),(a/2*boxCoef-0.000001,-b/2*boxCoef,0)
...

it works perfect. Maybe there is the division on zero somewhere?

Works perfect!
String with utils.alignedFacetBox drops off a lot of my code and that's
good.

But there is also a problem with "segmentation fault" in come cases.

What cases? The vertical one? I will have a look at the in the train 
now. Segfaults are grave errors that shouldn't never happen under normal 
circumstances. (Except when closing yade, there is some issue with 
python/log4cxx finalization). I will add check for coincident edges in 
Facet's constructor.

Yes, I more or less wrote a similar message recently. The presentation 
on wikia is not optimal, and there are many adds, which is always a bit 
strange for presenting an academic code (not criticism either, I'm not 
less responsible than others of the current situation anyway). I recall 
cloning the content to a site hosted on a Grenoble University server was 
in my plans. Perhaps merge both plans?

Very good!
However, is there any guarantee that wikidot will not inlude adds at a 
point? IIRC, wikia added more and more with time, and changed the pages 
presentation too.

Not much I guess... The problem as I see it here in Grenoble, is that we 
have many users who are not very experienced in sophisticated coding 
tools (me included). They are happy enough when they can install linux, 
download/compile Yade, handle c++ syntax and understand inheritance. At 
this point, they quit following the incredibly steep learning curve and 
focus on their PhD subject. Most of them won't even commit anything in 
their last PhD year if the superviser is not requesting so.

It is in fact hard to start using the advanced development tools when 
you don't know in what way they could help, or even you don't know they 
exist (see Vincent who is a skilled developper but keeps using cerr/cout 
instead of log4cxx :-P ).

Also, some crucial information about Yade is not in the wiki, nor in 
doxygen doc : it is in this mailing list. Which means new users will 
probably have hard time to find it.

What Jerome Duriez did once before was a really good idea : give a 
starting point for using Yade.
Now, it would be good a time for a "level 2" guide for Yade 
usage/development, which would summarize the advanced use of Yade. 
Perhaps not a big text, but at least a general view with pointers to 
relevant pages.

Emanuele Catalano will start working with Yade very soon (he used Yade 
last year during his master and he is now in 1st year of PhD), and he 
agreed to take notes and prepare this "lvl2" guide while he learns the 
advanced features himself.

I'm thinking about the following possible topics, feel free to add more 
if some come to mind :

- Downloading/compiling Yade
- Documentation (J. Duriez's begginers guide, wiki, doxygen + doxygen 
commenting convention) and how everybody can improve it.
- Creation of new classes and usage of SVN (I see people modifying 
existing classes to do what they want, best way to stop updating/commiting).
- Python console and scripts
- The logic of Sconscripts
- Kdevelop/CTags and perhaps more tricks to navigate in the code
- debuging tools
- usage of log4cxx
- bug tracking (?)
- Parallelization
- Profiling

I know something exists already on most aspects. Again, the idea is more 
to give links than to write a new doc from scratch.
Perhaps also update some of the existing-but-old wiki pages.

If everybody agree with this "table of content",
I propose to create on Wiki the document with such structure and everybody
can add the their information.

- Downloading/compiling Yade
- Documentation (J. Duriez's begginers guide, wiki, doxygen + doxygen
commenting convention) and how everybody can improve it.
- Creation of new classes and usage of SVN (I see people modifying existing
classes to do what they want, best way to stop updating/commiting).
- Python console and scripts
- The logic of Sconscripts
- Kdevelop/CTags and perhaps more tricks to navigate in the code
- debuging tools
- usage of log4cxx
- bug tracking (?)
- Parallelization
- Profiling

(The debate went over - a very good thing !! - since yesterday when I 
tried unfortunately to send this mail. I re-try almost to see if I 
succeed in sending a mail to Yade-users...)

I fully agreed with a previous remark of Bruno complaining that it was 
very difficult to find anything on the current site. I do not know 
either this is due to the use of wikia, or if wikidot could be better, 
but if this is the case, I think using a second wiki is a very good idea !

When I increase "grainSize" to 2 or more everything works fine.
But when it is 1 - "program kaput"

Would it be possible (Vincent?) to make wiki page collecting things that 
need to be documented? Be it precise things (that class needs doxygen 
docs) or more general ones (how do I do this in yade).

Horrible.

Nice topics. I agree, maybe some more, let's see what comes up! Thanks 
to Vincent for his initiative despice my initially discouraging comments :-)

Nice to see people are enthusiastic for that. Let's try to make the 
documentation better this time.

You can put ideas here (sorry, I added this page as a new category, 
which was obviously not a good idea...):

http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Category:New_documentation_structure_and_items


Remy Cailletaud already installed a wiki on 3SR server actually, but it 
is only for internal documentation, and not accessible from outside the 
university without login and password.
It is powered by wikimedia (gpl2), the same software as wikipedia. It 
should not be a big problem for Remy to create a second one for Yade 
with the same engine (only potential problems may be due to network 
security rules, we will see next week when Remy is back, but he had a 
solution last time I asked him).

The initial idea was to export the current wikia wiki and transfer the 
content to a 3SR wiki in some semi-automatic way.
Vincent's initiative to copy-paste manually, and re-organise pages at 
the same time needs more hardwork, but it removes the inherent 
complexity of cloning from wikia. Less work for Remy (shorter delays ;-)).
I'll keep you updated on this, I hope we can start next week.


I just checked alternatives to wikimedia here :  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software
There are too many of them!

I couldn't find what software wikidot is using, wich perhaps means they 
have their own private software.

Any other ideas abou what wiki engine to use?

Bruno

Some more ideas on that. It is a good idea to have a one server for
everything: common website, documentation, subversion, maybe forum etc.
And also important to have own domain name. For now there are: wikia.com,
berlios.de, launchpad.net.... I think it is not a good thing. And it is also
not a good for search machines.

I am actually quite happy with launchpad and we have everything there
(bug and feature tracking, mailing lists, package archive), except SVN
which is still at berlios -- once we switch (maybe) over to bzr, we can
have that at launchpad, too (we already tried once, but it didn't work
very well at that time) -- and wiki. Wiki at launchpad is a long
requested feature, but I don't think it will ever happen due to
resources launchapd would need for that:

Well, I think we should definitely decide what will be next steps: or we
continue to work on old wiki (wikia), or we work on wikdot, or we wait for
separate server in Grenoble...

If we do all of this things we'll get 0 result :(
So I even propose to do voting.

How can I make facets move? I was trying to add to utils.py

pp={'se3':[center[0],center[1],center[2],1,0,0,0],'refSe3':[center[0],center[1],center[2],1,0,0,0],'young':young,'poisson':poisson,'frictionAngle':frictionAngle,'inertia':[0,0,0],
'velocity':[velocity[0],velocity[1],velocity[2]]}

But it did not help

You have to use TranslationEngine and subscribe facets to it. That's 
what I do. See e.g. scripts/test/Dem3DofGeom.py for an example. The 
sphere is moved that way. Facet ids are returned by O.bodies.append.

ids=O.bodies.append([utils.facet(...),utils.facet(...)])

print ids ## [0,1,2,3,4]
O.engines=[...,TranslationEngine(subscribedBodies=ids,translationAxis=[0,0,1],velocity=1),...]

HTH, Vaclav

How can I get forces affected on 1 facet from spheres: I need it for plot?

Thank you

PS I promise, that I will place all answers to instructions or FAQ.

Unfortunately I know very very few python, so I do not know how to do 
this in this framework. With C++ instructions, (inside the code) it is 
like that

 dynamic_cast<Force*>(*Metabody-*>physicalActions->find(*id_facet*,actionForce->getClassIndex()) 
. get() )->force;
(I see clearly what can be the advantages of python by writing this...)

    An intermediate mean for you is (until someone can answer you more 
precisely) to add an Engine "ForceRecorder" (source in 
pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine/), defined with the id of the facet, to 
o.engines. This will store the force you want in an output file you can 
later analyse with the software you want.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] question about clump?
Message-ID: <20090605153302.4294.75461.launchpad@gangotri.canonical.com>

   Hello, everyone, sorry to bother you again!
   First thank Vaclav for the reply about box interaction. Vaclav
suggested me "replacing box by a few clumped spheres would be good
enough for your purposes."
   These days I try to learn how to use clump as the example in
yade(ClumpTestGen), but i noticed there seems exist some unreasonable
movement in the shear direction when I generated more some clumps in the
example(ClumpTestGen). is it because of the interaction between clumps?

I just make the plane bigger and add two more clumps as follow:

        shared_ptr<Body>
ground=Shop::box(Vector3r(0,0,-1),Vector3r(10,10,.2));

        // three-sphere clump
        clumpPos=Vector3r(0.5,2.5,2);
        relPos.push_back(Vector3r(0,-.5,.5)); radii.push_back(.5);
        relPos.push_back(Vector3r(0,.5,0)); radii.push_back(.5);
        relPos.push_back(Vector3r(.5,0,0)); radii.push_back(.5);
        createOneClump(rootBody,clumpPos,relPos,radii);
        relPos.clear(); radii.clear();

        // four-sphere clump (this one seems have abnormal movement,
horizontal translation in a curve (not a line) on the plane after
interaction)
        clumpPos=Vector3r(0.5,-2.5,2);
        relPos.push_back(Vector3r(0,0,0)); radii.push_back(.5);
        relPos.push_back(Vector3r(.5,0,0)); radii.push_back(.5);
        relPos.push_back(Vector3r(0,.5,0)); radii.push_back(.5);
        relPos.push_back(Vector3r(0,0,.5)); radii.push_back(.5);
        createOneClump(rootBody,clumpPos,relPos,radii);
        relPos.clear(); radii.clear();

        setDefault("param_damping",.8); //(made changes in shop)

        I set up time step=10e-5 on control panel.

   thank you very much!

 thank you for the reply!


    at the begining the clumps have both rotational and translational motion, but later the rotational motion finish and just have translational motion. at this time I found the clump slip on the plane in a curve. I think its trajectory should slip in a line, because there is no rotational motion and just have translational motion.

Hi,
 
I am working on a specific project and I need to know if I can make a hole
of specific dimensions at the bottom of a box such that grains (spheres) can
flow out under the application of stresses etc? 
 
I can proceed with YADE only if this is possible. Thank you.

Hi,
 
Thanks for confirming this. 
 
I tried getting the pdf, but I can't access it. I would be grateful if you
send me that document. 
 
Also, a part of my future problem is to flow fluid at different pressure
gradients through the desired geometry. I read your conference paper on a
similar issue but in 1D where you coupled YADE and OpenFOAM. I am not very
good at coding and this shall be my first time using LINUX. So can you just
describe to me how I can the effort be reduced in coding this stuff and if
there is an easier escape route now?
 
Thanks

Hi, Ripudaman:
 
According to your description, this model should be easily be modeled by
YADE, you can look at one of my previous publication:

Hi,

If no objection, I propose to create a second wiki (on wikidot.com)  
exclusively dedicated to yade documentation.
I personally use wikidot and I find it much more user-friend than wikia.

I could "design" and propose (in a first stage) a structure for the  
site. Then, any contributor will be able to add pages.
In worst cases, the second wiki may be deleted.

Please give me your opinion about this solution,

VR

The idea behind my proposal is to design a new structure for yade  
documentation.
I know also that the current wiki contains a large quantity of  
documentation thanks to contributors.
But honestly it is not very easy to find some information (this is  
NOT a criticism because I am very pleased to be able to access the  
informations contained in the wiki).

So I began this adventure in the hope that WE will find a nice design.
Here is a draft proposal of the doc structure: http://yade.wikidot.com

Have a look here: http://www.wikidot.org

It is said that wikidot is free (AGPLv3, see details on the site),  
the society is based in Poland, and the sources can be retreived with  
git at GitHub:
http://github.com/gabrys/wikidot

> Any other ideas abou what wiki engine to use?

Just informative comments:

wikimedia:

+ syntax seems to be compatible with wikia
+ well-known
+ Remi is experimented with it
-  nasty look (in my poor opinion)

wikidot:

+ easy to use (for the user, maybe administration is more complicated)
+ nice and clean look (top and side bars are customizable + css)
- Remi has no experience with it (but I know that he is not afraid of  
new challenges)
- syntax is quit different from common wiki
- ... ?

As Bruno said, we must talk with R?mi on monday.

We can:

I also hope that we will not stay on the third solution!

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] question about lattice model
Message-ID: <20090626222256.10872.34365.launchpad@gandwana.canonical.com>

Hello, everyone!

First, thank you all for the effort on Yade reference document. I think
it is very important for the new user (like me) to learn Yade.

Recently I tried to learn how to use lattice model and I tried the
latticeExample in Yade (version 0.12rc1), but I found Yade automatically
quited after I started the simulation for some time and some contents
(like [New Thread 0xb5fc56e0 (LWP 8331)]) were showed in the terminal.
Four data files also were generated, but only file (strains) has data.
So I want to know what's the problem with it and how can I fix it?

thank you very much! I greatly appreciate all your help.

if it crashed right after you started calculation, then it's a bug
that I don't know. 

if it crashed after the sample broke, then it is a known bug. It is
related to drawing in OpenGL a rod that is being deleted at the same
time (because it breaks). This does not occur when you close the
OpenGL window.

I never got around to fix this bug, beucase synchronising threads
(display <-> calculation) is so complex. But also, this bug never
bothered me too much, because when some serious calculations are
being run, the OpenGL display is always off (no point to draw
calculations that takes few days, better to look at it after it's
finished).

There are few more simple FileGenerator examples in the code in
latest trunk, you might want to try the svn version and see it.

oh, and IIRC if you check the option "sync.display" in the Display
tab of the Simulation Controller, then this problem disappears, and
calculation is going much slower.

Have a look at scripts/simple-scene-graph.py (it uses the old syntax for
instantiating yade classes, but you will figure that out. There is bunch of
comments there) There is something at
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/PythonPlotting, but it is a little out-of-date.
I will write something more elaborate beginning next week. Regards,

Oh, BTW, to get the force acting on body #1, use O.bex.f(1), for torque,
use O.bex.t(1) and so forth.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] crash in lattice model
Message-ID: <20090627145845.23415.17412.launchpad@gangotri.canonical.com>

Dear Janek Kozicki:

thank you for your suggestion, and i tried your method, but it still
crashed as before.

i also tried the simple FileGenerator examples in the code in latest
trunk. I should made some change in the code to let it through when i
compiled it (delete  latticeLaw->tension_compression_different_stiffness
= true;  add "false" in REGISTER_SERIALIZABLE(LatticeExampleSimple); ).
Then the compilation succeed.

For the simple example, once after I started the simulation, the four
control button in the Simulation tab of the Simulation Controller turn
grey, I can not stop or pause the simulation by myself. The simulation
will not stop, and there is no items in the OpenGL display (before i
started the simulation, i can see some node in the display).

I also found this in terminal.
"/home/daisy/build-0.12rc1/include/yade-0.12rc1/yade/core/MetaEngine2D.hpp:61
WARNING! dynamic cast of engine unit LatticeSet2LatticeBeams failed,
will use static_cast. Go figure why."

I think there may exist problems in version. some code can work in old
version (like version yade-0.11.1), but may not work in new version
(like version yade-0.12rc1). the version yade-0.12rc1 is also different
with the latest svn version.

I think this may be the reason for the crash.

Hi I have few questions to resolve before I can start using YADE
 
1) Is it possible to have a hertz mindlin contact law instead of a hooke's
contact law between granular particles?
 
2) Is it possible to compact an assembly under a prescribed anisotropic
stress state?
 
3) Is it possible to grow the size of a particle gradually?
 
4) Is it possible to create a circular hole at the base of a box through
which particles can escape?
 
thank you

I am new to YADE, but will try to answer. If I make a mistake, I think more
experienced users/developers will correct my answers.

You just need another "constitutive law"

Not sure, but I think yes.

You can pack the needed volume as you want. You just need exact mathematical

"Almost" circular hole can be simulated with polygon with many angles. Exact
circle hole is also possible but requires some more efforts. But with
open-source all is possible.

Hi, Ripudaman:
 
4) Is it possible to create a circular hole at the base of a box through which particles can escape?
 
As you might have seen from my paper, just increase the number of pieces of the plates (I used 8, while you can use 36 or 72, 36 is smooth enough though) to approximate your circular hole.

If you mean the law described e.g. in 
http://geology.msu.edu/pdf/Poisons_S_vel.pdf (2), it means computing
contact stiffnesses from bodies' rigidities differently and updating
them based on the (varying) confining force. Quite easy to do, and
certainly a welcome addition to yade (we are here to help you with
that).

There is ThreeDTriaxialEngine by Luc Sibille; Bruno/Luc will tell you
how to use it.


> 3) Is it possible to grow the size of a particle gradually?

TriaxialTest can use particle growth for compaction, you can certainly
do the same.

Anton and Vaclav answered that. Just one addition : I am not sure 
variable stiffness is the best approach here (though it had been  
partially implemented that way in some of the old contact laws).
It is better to define the function "H(un) : un -> fn" so that the force 
is always exactly what it should be. Computing the derivative H' 
(stiffness) to compute H(un+dun)=H(un)+H'(un)*dun will only introduce 
approximation errors, and probably instabilities, and it is not faster. 
Defining the "current" stiffness H' would only help defining the 
critical timestep.

Yes. See this function in TriaxialStressController.cpp (note you have to 
increase radii in bodies AND in interactions, as it's done in this 
function) :

/void TriaxialStressController::controlInternalStress ( MetaBody* ncb, 
Real multiplier )/

As said Vaclav, you can use the ThreeDTriaxialEngine for that.
With the ThreeDTriaxialEngine you can choose for each of the three space 
directions a control in strain or in stress. Thus, with respect to your 
question about an anisotropic stress state you can prescribe for 
instance a full control in stress to load the granular assembly from 
sigma_1 = sigma_2 = sigma_3 = 0 to sigma_1 = 100 kPa, sigma_2 = 75 kPa 
and sigma_3 = 250 kPa.

You can have a look at the particle growth implemented in the 
"TriaxialCompressionEngine" and mainly in the engine 
"TriaxialStressController", it works very well.

No, we were misinformed and R?mi is still not there. :(
Everyone can still put its ideas on yade.wikidot.com (register
to wikidot and join the site for that) or on Bruno's page:

http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/ 
Category:New_documentation_structure_and_items

In worst cases I don't think the work will not be lost.

Hi,

R?mi is back!
We discussed with him about hosting the second wiki.
He said OK. He will test wikidot and MediaWiki on a
virtual machine at Grenoble. The service should be
ready in 2 or 3 days.

So I'll come back with news in a few days...

But when I analyse diagrams from these tests, I get different results.

Why is it so? Is it normal?

No.

Randomness comes with uninitialised values. Try the same thing with 
"valgrind ./yade".

==15154== Use of uninitialised value of size 8
==15154== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

etc.

What should I look for?

If Yade has separate server, what about organizing there forum. For example,
on PHPBB engine?
I think it can add the mailing list.

You should see in valgrind output where the uninitialised values are 
instanciated/used (provided you compiled with -g).
I guess -O0 avoids optimizations, so that valgrind gives accurate 
results (optimisation can reorganise loops and such), I didn't know it 
was a prerequisite here, but it is probably not a bad thing.

So, I need to compile YADE with -g option and then start valgrind again?

I should use -g with scons?

Please no. Projects typically have only ML or only forums; if the have
both, only one of them is being used actively and it is confusing, seems
to me. I would prefer to keep as much stuff as possible at launchpad.
Having self-hosting has advantages of flexibility, but also
disadvantages of maintenance (including downtimes, who will do it once
Remi leaves and so on). V.

I agree, but I was thinking that ML is not so convenient for searching.
Maybe it is good to make a short FAQ from existed topics in ML?

I don't get it.. you picked files LatticeExampleSimple.[ch]pp from
trunk and compiled them with 0.12rc ? This mixing maybe works, but
shouldn't be done by unexperienced people. Either you are compiling
and using the svn treunk HEAD or 0.12rc. To try latest examples you
have to use HEAD.

this message you can safely ignore. It has nothing to do with lattice
and is related to some dynamic casting in C++ in general, not with
lattice.

you shouldn't be mixing different versions, unless you 100%
understand what you are doing.


Now, let me tell you about that OpenGL crash:

1. after you load simulation, you should be able to see a 3D view of
lattice sample which was generated. Click "center scene" if it's not
visible. Then you must see it. Not a single sphere, but a sample,
full of rods connected together.

2. then you have looked at your sample, you can click "right arrow"
button, to start simulation. It will start calculations, and it will
be displayed in 3D while being calculated.

3. "sync.display" checkbox may affect this, but in general it is a
known bug that simulation can crash *IF* the OpenGL window is opened
while calculating. I did no fix this, because I don't need to: all
serious calculation are ran *without* display. So to avoid crash,
simply close the view. After simulation is finished I am loading
automatically saved snapshots (using NullGUI) and look at the sample
in various stages of calculation.
This crash occurs, because it can happen that an element is being
drawn on the screen while simultaneously being deleted by the
calculating thread.

4. Run the simulation without OpenGL 3D view, by either just closing
it, or by running the simulation with NullGUI or python script. And
it will never crash and produce a correct physical result.


OpenGL is only used for debugging and is not useful for week-long
calculations, so it wasn't important enough for me to fix this crash.
Yes, I agree that it's very annoying.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Problem in ElasticContact law +
	needs clarification
Message-ID: <4A4D1F8B.6090207@hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello

Elastic contact law is broken in the default TriaxialTest. I guess it is 
linked with r1822.
It looks like friction is almost inactive ("almost" because shearForce 
is not null when I look into a xml, but the sample still has a 
negligible shear strength).

Not clear for me :

-What is the result of "#ifdef SCG_SHEAR" by default?
-TriaxialTest generates a contact law with useShear=0 by default, is 
that correct? When I put useShear=1, the result looks better.
-momentRotationLaw="1" by default, is that correct? (it has always been 
that way perhaps, if nobody opposes, i'll set it false by default)
-Could we please keep the old version of this contact law by default?

Bruno

I think not related, that was only renaming things. You can get
modifications here:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~vcs-imports/yade/trunk/annotate/head%
3A/pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine/ElasticContactLaw.cpp
.

SpheresContactGeometry stores current shear and prevNormal (which, as is
the current practice, what various InteractionPhysics' do).

However, it is used by the ElasticContactLaw only if useShear==True. In
that case, there is SpheresContactGeometry::updateShear, which uses the
incremental formulation to update displacement (not force), which is
then used to compute the force.

Without useShear, it uses the old algorithm that was there since ages,
the incremental one updating force, which I moved (a few months back) to
SpheresContactGeometry::updateShearForce to make it usable from
different constitutive laws, since that code was duplicated at least 5x.
But the code itself did not change, and IIRC (not sure 100%) I verified
that by running TriaxialTest with both versions (inline shear update vs.
updateShearForce) with exacly same results.

> -TriaxialTest generates a contact law with useShear=0 by default, is 
> that correct? When I put useShear=1, the result looks better.

I know there was some difference for triaxial with and without useShear,
and thought that perhaps I didn't write updateShear correctly (as
updateShearForce didn't have influence on the results). I didn't have
time (and interest) to solve that back then, so I disabled useShear by
default in triaxial. You can compare SpheresContactGeometry::updateShear
and ::updateShearForce, they are almost the smae from the top down.

> -momentRotationLaw="1" by default, is that correct? (it has always been 
> that way perhaps, if nobody opposes, i'll set it false by default)

It must have been like that since ages, as it is the default (in
ElasticContactLaw's ctor) and nothing sets that in TriaxialTest.

> -Could we please keep the old version of this contact law by default?

Which one is it? I had the same results for useShear==False as for the
original contact law, but to you the results don't seem correct; does
that mean that the old results were incorrect as well? Confusing stuff.

According to me momentRotationLaw="1" by default is not correct but I 
understood, that until now, this booleen is not used... Ok for 
momentRotationLaw="0"

> -Could we please keep the old version of this contact law by default?

Ok for me

The old results were at least approximately similar with the ones 
obtained now with useShear==true (i.e. peak stress approximately 3 times 
confining stress with a decent contact friction).

If you saw no difference between useShear==False and the old results, it 
means the bug has been introduced even before.
Unfortunately, I've been away from Yade for a few month and I can't 
really figure out what happened. It could be just a small mistake like 
the one introduced by JFJ once before.

I was really asking the default result of this #ifdef.
Apparently, SCG_SHEAR is defined by default, which is a bit strange 
since useShear is false by default at the same time.

Could it be part of the problem?

No, it is #defined by default so that you can choose at runtime which
algorithm to use; I wasn't sure at that time if the algorithm was right,
and I wanted to clearly separate if from the old code at the level of
the code. (Can we move the discussion to the bugreport? I already wrote
a response there ;-) ) V.

Hello,

I have created the class, derived from BodyMacroParameters.
How can I access those variables from Python scripts.

Thank you.

PS Sorry for stupid questions :)

Message-ID: <1246793820.4097.15.camel@flux>

Hello everybody,

it seems there is quite many people using/developing yade now, but we
don't know much about you. I would like to collect this kind of
information so that we can steer in some way the development, to see
what annoys you, what you work on etc. Being open-source, yade builds on
your (that means _you_ who is just reading this, not some abstract
"you") participation and I would like to make that more intensive.

We ocasionally get such information from brave newcomers on the mailing
list (like Anton lastly -- thanks!), but I suppose there is many more
people who don't speak up for some reason.

I created a wiki page at http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/WhoIsDoingWhat ,
where I would like to ask you to tell us something about yourself and
your work. Fell free to not stick to the template and provide other
information that could interest us: your voice counts.

Please forward this message to people that are not subscribed the list
but work with/on yade, such as your master students and stagiers.

Thanks for your cooperation,

V?clav

The new Wiki engine is operational!

All we need now is to open the port for it. It will be ****.hmg.inpg.fr 
(I suggested **** = yade...).

Those who have an account in the lab (Janek/Va?lav?)  can access it 
already with ssh :

ssh -C yourlogin at a0meije.hmg.inpg.fr -L 443:srvyade01.hmg.inpg.fr:443 (you can accept exception safely)

then 

https://localhost

It should be fully operational for everybody very soon anyway.

Bruno

Thanks for those who wrote about themselves, can others do the same as
well? 

Nice to hear things that I wasn't aware of, and I perhaps need some
clarifications.

Vincent: "I don't feel good with interaction parameters that are stored
(embeded) in bodies": I am not sure what you mean here.

Bruno: "The time gain with "parallel" option is still very low". What
speedups you get? For TriaxialTest(fast=True,numberOfGrains=10000), I
have 48 vs. 28 iter/sec by setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to 4 and 1
respectively. If you have some ideas for improvements, they will be very
welcome.

Anton: "Good to have YADE deb-package in repositories.". The
infrastructure is there, https://launchpad.net/~yade-users/+archive/ppa
has (one) package, but given the speed how yade evolves and until
recently, you couldn't practically use it without writing c++ code, it
didn't make much sense to distribute binaries.

(I will paste these discussions to the wiki page WhoIsDoingWhat so that
it doesn't get lost. If you want, open bugreport/create blueprint for
those features you need. That's perhaps the best way to keep track.)

Vaclav

first things first. Please make sure the we don't have any version
conflicts here.

Please delete your ~/.yade-* directories
Then please delete your ~/YADE/ (backup anything you might need later)
Then download again latest svn, compile it and run.

It is a common error that yade uses some old plugins from previous
versions, than are incompatibile, perhaps we would need some kind of
binary lib* versioning to prevent that. It became my habit to delete
config files and old binary files in case of some inexplicable
problems.

PS: please reply to the mailing list (not in private), it's better to
keep the discussion public.

best regards

Oh!! I still have to try this. I was only looking at this yesterday : 
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Triaxial_Test_Parallel

Suggesting a max of 25% speedup. Has it change?

I had a few ideas, like merging geomEngineUnit and physEngineUnit (less 
loops and less sync), or at least don't dispatch interactions when 
i->physics exists . I tried that, it gives 3% speedup just moving 
if(!interaction->interactionPhysics) from the engine unit to the dispatcher.
However, I saw you already merged geom+physics+contact law, so I gave 
up... Is this merged version in the current SVN?
Btw, the scripts/test/triax-perf.py you refer to in this page in not in 
the trunk.

Other questions :
I don't see any parallel command in the triaxialTest or in 
ElasticContactLaw. How can it work?
Do you still have those big cpu time for the collider with 50k spheres? 
I could have a few ideas for this.

Regarding paralelization, we are working on solid-fluid coupling and we 
will use a solver that support parallelization for solving large linear 
systems (an open source library called "taucs", used for sparse system 
in mathematica, matlab, comsol and various good commercial codes). I 
think it will be the good time to start using our multiproc server with 
paralel Yade (I admit I did not really use this server yet...).

You can still run triaxial tests with various number of grains, 
friction, granulometry, compacity, etc. Not a negligeable thing as the 
triaxial test is the first simulation for more than 50% of the dem users 
I think.

Sorry, I have been announcing that a bit fast.
It is summer time here and Remi is not sure the administration will open 
the port very soon...
Only a few of us can access it at the moment.
Let us stick with wikia in the meantime.

One remark about the "WhoIsDoingWhat" page : don't underestimate the 
number of users who don't read the mailing list (yes, they use an old 
version too), you will have to spam them everyday and hope they will see 
the announcement. :-P

And I was planning to remove the old version more than 6 months
ago... but still I can't find time for that, heh ;)

Yes, since perhaps more than a month. it is the InteractionDispatchers
that is activated for TriaxialTest::fast. If you have some other ideas
for speed, add them somewhere at the bottom of
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Performance_Tuning

> Btw, the scripts/test/triax-perf.py you refer to in this page in not in

Sorry, I fixed that page. It should be examples/triax-perf/triax-perf.py
(see comments in it)

> I don't see any parallel command in the triaxialTest or in 
> ElasticContactLaw. How can it work?
Dispatchers handle that (either the triplet
InteractionGeometryEngineUnit, InteractionPhysicsEngineUnit,
ConstitutiveLawDispatcher; or InteractionDispatchers in one loop) with a
few openmp #pragma statemenets. The number of threads is set by the
OMP_NUM_THREADS env var in the shell.

> Do you still have those big cpu time for the collider with 50k spheres? 
> I could have a few ideas for this.

I didn't run that with InsertionSortCollider (it didn't exist back
then), but as seen from http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Colliders_performace,
the collider should be about 2x faster. But it scales the same, so you
will get 80% of time in collider once you use 100k spheres again.
(BTW is it OK if I use InsertionSortCollider in TriaxialTest by default,
even without "fast"?)

(taucs has been last released in 2003, does that give you great deal of
confidence in its future?). How often are you going to solve the sparse
system? If at every step, most time will be spent there probably (unless
you have 100k+ particles). If taucs runs multi-threaded (it seems it
does), it may interact badly with openMP threads which will be allocated
independently. You will see.

Hm, good point. I would like to release yade at  some near future point,
just for such purposes. Please add bugs and attach them to the 0.20-0
milestone so that we can track what rests to be done. It looks more or
less stabilized now.

Updated. 58% for the collider with 50k spheres, in the "best" case. 71%
for the overall fastest case :-(

**kw means that reamining arguments will be converted to dictionary.
Therefore, if you had something like args={'arg1':value1,'arg2':value2}
before, you should say 

 utils.box(..., arg1=value1,arg2=value2)

or, if you are lazy, pass the dictionary but expand it to the arguments 
by saying utils.box(...,**args).

(BTW, single * expands tuple to sequence of unnamed arguments in python,
so that  f(1,2,3) and args=(1,2,3); f(*args) are the same).

HTH, Vaclav

Ok, I'm discovering this new collider now. 2x faster? That is good.
But I don't understand why a collider scaling with Nparticles is so bad, 
other engines scale the same way don't they?
Did you implement the x/y/z threads trick for parallel collider?
Ok for using it in triaxial test.

Another option, for quasistatic simulations, is to use triangulation or 
one of the old collider with radiusFactor = 1.2, and update the contact 
list only once per N iterations. Depending on max velocity in the model, 
N can be set to at least 10. You can adjust N during runtime 
automatically if maxVel increases somewhere. In some very slow 
compression tests, N could really be 50 or so.

Anyway, the size of the fluid problem scales with the number of 
partices. It won't be solve at each time step. Only the right-hand side 
of the problem will vary at each iteration (M.X=b with b varying all the 
time but M varying each N iterations, like above)

Mmmmh... Interesting, but not a very good news. Taucs works impressively 
well in single thread. Do you know anything equivalent designed for openMP?

Let me ask this again before I start working on this :

I confirm that the current behaviour of ElasticContactLaw (requesting 
deletion of interactions as soon as contact is lost), disable capillary 
forces between distant grains.
I'm about to implement a "interactionDetectionFactor" in ElasticLaw the 
same way as in 
InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry, and delete 
interactions only if distance is larger than (r1+r2)*factor.

Anybody has a better idea?

Sure! I suggest we don't use Yade mailing list for this specific topic, 
as there is already a lot of traffic here these days (good to see btw).
In short, Emanuele Catalano is interested in internal flows in dense 
packings, using finite volumes.

It scales N*log(N) (theoretically), and that is bad enough (black and
red curves at http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Colliders_performace ).  

It is bad because efficiency of parallelization (of the interaction
loop) grows with number of particles - as one step takes longer time,
the constant overhead of parallelization scheduling (etc) gets
proportionally smaller. And this nice effect is pretty much killed by
the collider.

Agreed. But is there such collider written? (I know there are papers
about that.) What is the computation complexity of triangulation
collider? I know that the grid-based ones achieve O(N), but we don't
have that implemented either.

Maybe 
http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/, but there must be more, I am
quite sure. But you can easily limit current number of threads for
openMP and allocate those to taucs, or just let the OS do the
thread-battle by itself.

Before, it was the geometry functor deciding on which interaction to
delete (and there had to be IS2IS4SCGWater), now this responsibility
shifted to the constitutive law; so it is logical.

Wouldn't it be better, however, to create a separate constitutive law? I
fear a little that at some point everybody will ad his/her own
parameters into ElasticContactLaw. Maybe not grounded, though; this one
distanceFactor seems OK to me.

Don't add it to ElasticContactLaw, however, but to
ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw (shouldn't it be renamed to
Law2_Spheres[ContactGeometry]_Elastic[ContactInteraction]_Elastic for
clarity) and use ConstitutiveLawDispatcher/InteractionDispatchers.
ElasticContactLaw is nothing but loop around calls to
ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw with typecheck. Slower and
non-parallelizable.

Oh, BTW, is there agreement on having useShear by default and
progressively remove prevNormal from various InteractionPhysics classes?

I would be also interested to see what is going on with fluids, please
do not keep that private (unless secret). Perhaps the best would that
you go to https://launchpad.net/people/+newteam to create something like
yade-fluid team; then you get mailing list to which other people can
subscribe as they will.

(In the same way as there is still the yade-python team, which was
however less successful that I hoped...)

Hi, 
 
I can honestly tell you what I have at this moment, the OpenFOAM solver and YADE are working well with each other, the function Sergei mentioned about exporting YADE's data to paraView is also available and working well (also one to FeatPost), you might see these screenshots in my webpage (sheet pile and fluidized bed), but there are still some internal problems with the solution equations, that is why I do not release the code at this time.
 
You are OK to ask me questions if you have trouble with this procedure.

Sure! I suggest we don't use Yade mailing list for this specific topic,
as there is already a lot of traffic here these days (good to see btw).
In short, Emanuele Catalano is interested in internal flows in dense
packings, using finite volumes.

WHAT?? You have export to paraView on which I almost started working and
that code is not in trunk? Come on, man! ;-) It is OK if the code is not
perfect (that's what trunk is for), but duplicating other's work feels,
to say the least, unconfortable.

(BTW, you have many interesting things on the webpage)

Written? Yes, any of the colliders we have would do the job. Just set an 
interval for e.g. insertionSortCollider, and run it periodically with 
detectionFactor = 1.5.
During N timesteps, use the same list of interactions (some will go from 
virtual to real, or real to virtual, no problem with that as long as 
they can change many times).
I experimented that before with the triangulation collider, it worked 
well, but it was not faster than SAPcollider for a stupid reason (*), 
and I realised the same thing could be achieved with SAPcollider with 
intDetectionFactor=1.5.
It needs a few adjustments in other classes now, perhaps, perhaps not. 
For instance, i'm not sure requestDeletion(i) will let "i" become real 
again, but this would be minimal changes.
The problem with CGAL::triangulation is its not parallel.

(*) the triangulation was fast, but iterations on all edges (i.e. 
virtual contacts) was slow, because the data structure has only 
vector<edge> and vector<cell>. There are workarounds but I'm not on that 
now.
Soon however, we will have a triangulation in metabody to simulate flow, 
so I guess it will be time to remove the collider and use the same 
triangulation for flow and contact detection (in our specific problems).

We will experiment, thank you for the tip. I'm not so sure a lot of 
algebra libraries with parallel features are available.

Note that we stopped using IS2IS4SCGWater after the intFactor was 
implemented in IS2IS4SCG.
I think it is correct to define intFactor in the same law, because 
anybody using more than one physical law between the same bodies would 
have the same problem.

Good point.

I'd prefer to keep the traditional (Cundall) incremental form for now. 
The equations are simpler, especially in 3D, so it is easier to 
understand what happens and implement different laws. I will change my 
mind one day perhaps, but for now I feel like the incremental form is 
good enough for dry friction. :)

Remember. It was just prototype code for a data-structure based one

This is impressive!
We have slower (Stokes) flow and denser material than in the fluidized 
bed problem. The 1D soil example you show is a good prototype of the 
type of problems we want to solve.
Our mesh is tetrahedral with spheres at vertices.


What is the balance between Yade and openFOAM cpu time in your examples?

Hello

As if I had nothing more important to do, I played with Yade google map 
and set locations for a few yade-users list members.
In some case, it was just a fast guess, in other cases I did not have

This map looks... "interesting" :)

Don't we have any user in China?!!

Hi, Vaclav:
 
Please understand that you would have so many things to do when you graduate, and I am relocating from one state to another and the new job here takes most of my time, I even do not have time to revise a submitted manuscript :-|, and it is quite bit awkward that I do not even have a chance to learn the commands for uploading the code to the SVN, sorry for being so lazy :-) I never complain that there is no document in YADE, because I understand it is very common for many open source codes (e.g. for OpenFOAM there is even less), especially for research codes, I am still using the yade.0.11.1 (the version that require compile QGLViewer separately), because I never have time to keep up with the SVN with so many daily changes, especially changing class names or function names, as a PhD candidate, the most important thing for me is to get a correct solution for a specific problem and I am very reluctant to spend time on re-compiling of the code because another slight change in the SVN, not to mention those naming conventions, class names, etc.......
 
To be more detail, the code for exporting YADE's data to paraView is only within the revised OpenFOAM solver, as I have mentioned before, there is still a problem with the Navier-Stokes equation solution so I really think it improper to release the code which will confuse most people. Finally, the code for exporting YADE's data to paraView is very simple (no more than 100 lines), and I just used OpenFOAM's "foamToVTK" command to convert only the particle data (no walls) to .vtk files, it would take me a while to clean up the codes and comments even if I just release the current version. The proposed releasing time might be on August or September.
 
Anyway, I think YADE is really a nice code and I appreciate those original authors (especially Vaclav and Janek) for their great work, even if I do not work on research about DEM currently I am still reading the mailing list everyday but most of the time I just look at what other people are doing, if there is any problems that I can answer I will help, and I know one student in my previous department is working on the clump, and I am pretty sure he is also looking at this mailing list:-)
 
Please allow me one or two weeks to learn the SVN, trunk, etc, it would be difficult for me to find a time to read basic SVN tutorials, especially I need to find those tutorials myself first :-D

WHAT?? You have export to paraView on which I almost started working and
that code is not in trunk? Come on, man! ;-) It is OK if the code is not
perfect (that's what trunk is for), but duplicating other's work feels,
to say the least, unconfortable.

(BTW, you have many interesting things on the webpage)

What is the balance between Yade and openFOAM cpu time in your examples?

-> I never tested that CPU time, and for my research topic, nobody cares, but I can test that :-)

Bruno

p.s. I created a launchpad team "DEM fluid coupling", waiting approval
for the mailing list.

-> Thanks a lot!

This map looks... "interesting" :)

Don't we have any user in China?!!
 
-> I am from Shanghai, China, but working in US currently :-))), I am not sure if YADE is blocked by some internet gateways in China, but maybe we can find a mirror which is hosted in China, I know a lot of people in China Universities are interested in YADE, because I have got several personal emails.

We would need to define some measure of maximum velocity and adjust 
collider's interval so that we wouldn't miss interactions. I am not sure 
how much it would help, as number of AABB overlaps is proportional to 
detectionFactor^3, whereas time savings are linear to the stride of 
collider wakeups. As we have ABB overlaps in the same container as real 
interactions, it will also slow down loop over interactions (shouldn't 
we split that in 2  containers?). I will try to experiment with that; I 
created https://blueprints.launchpad.net/yade/+spec/collider-stride to 
track the idea.

"Written?"=triangulation collider. I am still not sure about legal 
status of CGAL, if we may use it or not. They have something about using 
it in GPL programs on their license page, but it is not very clear. 
They're killing their product by those restrictions, at least for me 
(too bad they have python wrappers for their lib, also).

There is PLENTY! At least those oofem uses are 
http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/overview and 
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/, which are damn good as far as I 
know (see also 
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/miscellaneous/external.html).

Ah, nay, there is still misunderstanding here. Read 
SpheresContactGeometry::updateShear and compare it to updateShearForce. 
It is the _same_ incremental formulation, but it increments shear 
_displacement_ (rather than _force_), which is, I think, what most 
constitutive laws need (even if they are non-linear) and therefore can 
use. I would like to have that incremental formulas at one place only. 
(The non-incremental algo is in Dem3Dof* classes and I am quite happy 
with it.)

Hi, all!

I have a proposal to create 1 page on WIKI, what will include links to ALL
pages in WIKI.
Like content page.

I think it is necessary because it is almost impossible to find some pages
in WIKI.
If we have it, we can divide this page in several sections: for beginners,
for developers, common information etc.

Like this? http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Special:AllPages and 
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Categories ? (you can put links to 
the title page, that wouldn't hurt, true)

you need to put a [[Category:Developer guide]] inside a wiki page,
and it will be put by the wiki engine automatically into this
category. Just look at how other pages are written.

This "Content page on wiki" is in fact the "Browse YADE" expandable
tree on the fron page, just click it, and you will see all the
categories and articles.

"All" means all those that have a proper [[Category:SOMETHING]]
written inside them.

This is one of the reasons you should have your code in subversion,
since every time I do some changes, I am trying (of couse not always
suvccessful) to modify in the right way all the code affected.

I hope Kien is reading this also, because he addressed the same issue
(of frequently changing code) at the WhoIsDoingWhat page.

Nothing to do about that if your code sits in your computer.

All users are on the same boat: no one is paid just for development,
without needing results (including me). OTOH, thinking of immediate
results all the time will kill the project quite soon. There must be
some balance between long-term development and results here and now; we
are all trying to learn how to make that compromise.

Howgh ;-)

are all trying to learn how to make that compromise.

->This is a very important and difficult question for every user :-), and this goes to the software engineering issue, we might need to learn from other larger open source projects, how they did that? Especially people like me who leave the research area but is still keeping an eye on the project.

Hehe, I know there are plenty, but Metis is a preconditionner, not a 
solver, and in fact taucs is using Metis. ;-)
I compiled taucs and linked it with the last version of metis. And yes, 
it works well, but metis is not the fastest preconditionning method for 
our matrices (in single thread at least).
Taucs is actually linking with some of the libraries you see everywhere 
in algebra web pages (blas, lapack, metis, atlas).

We can't use fem/fvolumes and such codes out of the box because we are 
assembling our won matrice in a non-traditional way.
If we use such programms, it is only by calling low level functions, 
which in many cases means using taucs...

I saw one interesting thing in miscellaneous/external, though :

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/plapack/

taucs is based on lapack, but I don't think it uses plapack. plapack 
will be something to consider perhaps.
Thanks.

Don't worry, Vincent has this (and a lot more) in mind already. All we 
need is this new wiki up before spending time on it.

At first sight, this is not for sparse systems (I could run out of 
memory with sparse N*5(non-zeros) matrices, so forget N*N matrices...).
We need a library specialised for sparse, positive definite, symmetric 
matrices. Any non-specialised lib will be slower than a specialised lib 
for those matrices IMO.
But don't waste you time searching for us. :)

Eigen has sparse-system solvers (and they look quite fast, according to 
their benchmarks): http://eigentuxfamily.org ; it doesn't run in 
paralle, but is higly optimized c++ (using SSE2 instructions, for 
instance, on machines that support it)

Hi, all!

How can I get current position of Facet for plotting the graph?
This code

yade.plot.plots={'t':('Z_pr')}
def myAddPlotData():
    press=O.bodies[id_press]

yade.plot.addData({'t':O.time,'Z_pr':press.phys['se3'][2],'F':O.bex.f(id_press),.....

Does not work.

Thank you

What do you mean, "does not work"? (Post your script if unsure)

Oh! perhaps you meant

yade.plot.plots={'t':('Z_pr',)}

(note the comma: that makes the ('Z_pr',) a 1-tuple; ('Z_pr') is just 
string that is put into redundant parentheses and you will get some 
weird error.

One more small question. If I want 2 diagrams to be appeared:
       yade.plot.plots={'t':('Z_pr',),'F':('t')}
It works,

but when I change F and t:
      yade.plot.plots={'t':('Z_pr',),'t':('F')}
I receive only 't':('F') diagram, first one does not appears...
Thank you

That's normal,  python dicts have only one value per key; try this:

 a={'a':1,'a':2}
 print a # {'a': 2}

since 'a':1 was overwritten. What you have to do is to create
differently-named t axis:

yade.plot.plots={'t':('Z_pr',),'t_':('F',)}

(you can name it as you want, I just appended the "_" (and do not forget
the comma after 'F' again)) and in addPlotData, you will have

 't':O.time,'t_':O.time,...

Is it possible to make different y-values from right side of the diagram?
MatPlotLib manual?

No, not currently. Matplotlib can do it, sure
(http://matplotlib.sf.net/gallery.html), but I tried to wrap it in a
very minimalistic interface to avoid lot of code for simple plots. For
now, do 2 graphs with the same x-axis and file a wishlist bug about
y2axis so that I don't forget. Vaclav

I added that now, along with fixing
https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/399360 (tuple vs. string). Use the
string '|||' to separate y1axis from y2axis:

{'t':'Z_pr','t_':('F',('g','go-'),'|||','F2')}

note 1: 'Z_pr' will work (before, you would have to say ('Z_pr',) )
note 2: F and g will be plotted on y1 on the second figure, F2 on y2;
'|||' separates those
note 3: ('g','go-'): the 2nd string is marker specifier as in matlab,
see
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot (and scripts/siple-scene-graph.py).

(you can add all that to the faq :-) )

If '|||' seems ugly, propose something else, it doesn't really matter.

Vaclav

So, what about "creating bug" on this item?
I mean we can include creating LVL2 Guide to Milestone 0.20.0

Any ideas?

Message-ID: <930069bf0907300140s11169d4dwd1e8196e5421c8e0@mail.gmail.com>

Can I stop the simulation for specific reasons, using Python?
Is there the command like "o.stop" or something like that?

Thank you.

I should write documentation for those functions. I haven't done it
before as I was the only person using it ;-)

That is very convenient! No necessity to recompile the code all the time.

In core/Omega.hpp you can see that there are some definitions of 
fonctions Omega::stopSimulationLoop(); or Omega::finishSimulationLoop();
You can get some details about it on 
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.physics.yade.user/978/focus=979
So, you can surely use them in Python also, but I do not know the exact 
syntax...

The process didn't exit cleanly -- probably a crash or abort. What does
the log say at the end? Unfortunately, we get SEGV at the end from
log4cxx (probably), and there is no way to tell what caused the crash
just from the exit status.

BTW, when yade-multi is running, try http://localhost:9080

It works normally, I get normal results.
I just dont know what that string means.

During simulation, I use Omega::instance().stopSimulationLoop();
Can it be the reason?

Yade crashes at exit (after stopping the simulation etc), probably a bug
in log4cxx.

> During simulation, I use Omega::instance().stopSimulationLoop();
> Can it be the reason?
No.

This is from the SEGV handler in main.cpp. Were it crashing in the
normal code, debugger would be started. Just ignore that for now, though
I would like to have it fixed that some day (either when they fix
log4cxx or we move to boost::log, if it is ever created).

I am not sure bug is it or what. So I post it here.

I cant start a new script rb.py. It says:

 File "rb.py", line 66, in <module>

spheres=pack.triaxialPack(pack.inHyperboloid((0,0,-.5*specimenLength),(0,0,.5*specimenLength),.25*specimenLength,.2*specimenLength),radius=sphereRadius,memoizeDb='/tmp/triaxPackCache.sqlite',young=young,poisson=poisson,frictionAngle=frictionAngle,physParamsClass='CpmMat',density=density)
  File

line 265, in triaxialPack
    autoCompressionActivation=False # stop once unloaded
AttributeError: 'TriaxialTest' object has no attribute 'load'


How can I fix it?

Thanks

OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 yade-trunk ...

or to apply it also to next invocations in the same shell (terminal)

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

Number of threads must be set when program starts (it seems; I wasn't
able to change it at runtime, although there is a function provided for
that)

If you use yade-multi, columns prefixed with bang are passed as env vars
to the process automatically:

!OMP_NUM_THREADS some
1 3.4
2 3.4
3 3.4

Best, Vaclav

What is the right syntax for that? I use in the first string

!OMP_NUM_THREADS 1

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Peak results
Message-ID: <930069bf0908070024n41de95c1u8bc0596b00510888@mail.gmail.com>

Has anybody the problem with "peak results"?
I mean, when you record the data from anything, for example force affecting
on facet or sphere,
sometimes you get "pick results" which are twice or more larger than normal
result.
It happens just for a short period, like a noise.

Thanks in advance

Eh, probably everybody has had that problem. 

Taking force on 1 particle makes no sense, you have to average it
somehow. DEM doesn't solve for equilibrium, therefore you can either let
the simulation stabilize somehow (dissipate all the kinetic energy), or
average somehow what you see over larger area (or both). You can compute
forces on a specimen cross-section or some meaningfully defined set of
particles; if you have a facet that touches many spheres, that could be
a good candidate as well, as long as the sphere move independently.

You can try taking force from 1 single particle and smooth it using
moving average or similar techniques (they are available in the numpy
package), but that is just "graph aesthetics".

e.g. examples/concrete/uniaxial sums forces (in UniaxialStrainer) on all
particles that are considered supports and lower and higher supports are
then averaged. There are still some osciallations (as there are waves
going back and forth in the specimen), but that is not so marked unless
you go to very high loading rates. The same example also plots
cross-section forces (i.e. forces in interactions that cross that plane)
and you can see that they differ.

Hi,

I want to calculate the total number of cohesive contacts in my model.
How can I declare the global variable for that?

Thank you

No globals, sorry. You can make a variable static in some of your
classes, but it is discouraged in general (e.g. you would not be able to
use O.switchWorld() consistently). You have to update that number
somehow, anyways.
 
If you need that number just once in a while, count the interactions
like this:

long n=0;
FOREACH(const shared_ptr<Interaction>& I, *rootBody->interaction){ if(I->isReal()) n++; }

In python, you can use O.interactions.countReal().

HTH, Vaclav

When I use yade-multi, in some simulations I get negative O.realtime.
Why can it happen? Is it necessary to reset this parameter all the time?

You can file bug about that to not forget, I've seen it a few times in
normal simulation; it is not related to yade-multi I think. I never
considered it serious enough to warrant more attention, though... V

The problem is that it happens accidentally. I cant accurately say when.

But will watch for that.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Compilation of SVN using scons
	always re-compiles	everything
Message-ID: <07200ABDA779AA41BD5747E1FE9E0A09A2A3D4@kstud7.utk.tennessee.edu>

Hi, all:

I am trying to use the latest svn recently, after checked with svn, and then typed the command:

scons PREFIX=/home/fchen/YADE1937 optimize=1

The scons compiled everything well.

However, if I modified a file: Preprofessor/DEM/ClumpTestGen.cpp

and the scons started to compile everything again, no matter I use the same command, or just type "scons", it will first delete the intermediate file, like core.o, and then re-compile a new one.

Then I did a test by first re-check with svn, do a clean, new build and then without modifying anything, type the same build command, "scons", and scons still started to re-build everything again.

Can anyone tell if I did something wrong?

Thanks a lot!

Hi, Anton Gladky:

Thanks for the reply, but it does not seem to work, it still re-compiles everything. What I did is add a line

version='something_to_add' //is this correct???

to the file: trunk/scons.current-profile //this file is empty when I first download

or I should change the "something_to_add" to the version number like version='svn1940'? or I should pass this parameter direct to scons?

Thanks in advance!

This file should contain the string:
         version='something_to_add'

You can give any name. I use, for example,
   version = 'current'
or
   version = 'new_build'

It does not really matter

> or I should pass this parameter direct to scons?
>
You can pass this parameter directly to scons. in this case you dont need to
edit  scons.profile-default: it will be automatically added there.

Hi, Anton Gladky:

Thanks, it is working now, I am wondering where is this information saved in the configuration file? Although it is not re-compiling, but I saw the scons.current-profile is empty and the scons.profile-default does not contain the version information? i.e. How does the scons know it is a new build or not? Thanks!

scons.profile-default:

PREFIX = '/home/fchen/YADE1940'
optimize = True
exclude = 'none'
features = 'log4cxx,openGL,python'
QTDIR = ['/usr/share/qt3', '/usr/lib/qt', '/usr/lib/qt3', '/usr/qt/3', '/usr/lib/qt-3.3']
CXXFLAGS = []
SHCCFLAGS = ['-fPIC']

As I understand, if you do not insert the "version" option to your scons
command line, scons uses SVNXXXX parameter for version. That is why,
updating your svn repository you get another "version" that is why it
recompiles wholly.

If you insert version at least for 1 time, it will allways recompile only
changed modules (actually, sometimes it takes a lot of time, when core is
changed)

Thanks Anton Gladky for your active response, I will look at how the scons read this parameter if I have time!

As I understand, if you do not insert the "version" option to your scons
command line, scons uses SVNXXXX parameter for version. That is why,
updating your svn repository you get another "version" that is why it
recompiles wholly.

If you insert version at least for 1 time, it will allways recompile only
changed modules (actually, sometimes it takes a lot of time, when core is
changed)

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Problem about old boost version on
	cluster (scientific	linux) when compiling YADE
Message-ID: <07200ABDA779AA41BD5747E1FE9E0A09A2A3D9@kstud7.utk.tennessee.edu>

Hi, all:

I might have asked this problem before, I am now recently again trying to compile YADE on HPC cluster, the cluster has a scientific Linux environment with an old boost version of 1.31, the administrator said it difficult for him to update the boost for some reason, and I am now trying to have a local build of the latest boost version 1.39, however the scons seems to only look for boost at '/usr/local/boost' but not the path where I put the latest boost 1.39, 
I tried using the CPPPATH='/fchen/DEM_CFD/boost_1_39_0' and 
LIBPATH='/fchen/DEM_CFD/boost_1_39_0/lib' 
and even tried CXX='/fchen/DEM_CFD/gcc-4.1.2/bin/g++', 
it does not help, is there a way to force scons to look for boost headers and libs in my specified folder?

Thanks a lot!

Boost are not handled in any special way compared to other libs. Setting
CPPPATH and LIBPATH is enough, provided the libs are called the same.
Have a look $buildDir/config.log, that has all the commands and what
failed (compiler messages, linker messages etc).

It does not work for me now.

bzr push lp:~gladky-anton/yade/just-to-test
Source repository format does not support stacking, using format:
  Development repository format - rich roots, group compression and chk
inventories
Source branch format does not support stacking, using format:
  Branch format 7

And it starts to push all revisions.

Do you have bzr >=1.16? Also, try to say "bzr upgrade --2a" before the
push. V.

"bzr upgrade --2a" converted something, but it did not help

To launchpad, of course. If the stacking doesn't work for you, it is not
important ATM, for now it is enough to have basic svn-like
functionality.

> "bzr upgrade --2a" converted something, but it did not help

The same message as before? It will upload about 64kB of data even if
stacking without other changes; at least that is what I got in my case.
(BTW you probably realized you have to say "bzr upgrade --2a
path/to/your/repo")

Cheers, V.

> Where is it possible to get all of possible parameters to change?

r=qt.Renderer()
r.keys() # get just the keys 
r.dict() # get both keys and values; you need r1709 for that

just like with any other yade object in python.

For Renderer, the same params can be set from tu GUI (the Display tab);
and you can also have a look at OpenGLRenderingEngine code.

For the view (per-view params), which is not yade object, you can do:

v=qt.View()
v.<tab> # will show completions
dir(v)

and also see scripts/gl-test.py

I do not know if it is the best but I write here instead of the site.

    From my experience : I feeled that the time I spent to learn a bit 
C++ was not lost : it helped me to find some known structures and 
characters in the ocean of code I had in front of me at the beginnings. 
Quite good when you have nothing to hang at...

    For the other things, I'm very not up to date (and the activity of 
these last days let me think that  this will be incredibly worser and 
worser) with the latest Yade facilities so I'm not sure my opinion is to 
be considered. But it seems to me that Python is not too much 
complicated, taking moreover into account the fact that some examples 
exist (and that Vaclav always answer rather quickly to such questions on 
the list, thanks to him !!)
    And I do not even know what is this MatPlotlib ?? I guess it is for 
plotting results. In my case, I use always Recorder-issued files and 
Matlab. I find it satisfying.

Subject: [deprecated list] We have moved to launchapad.
Message-ID: <20090824174744.257e5d77@atak.bl.pg.gda.pl>

Hello,

This is the last message from this obsoleted mailing list.

Our main server has finally completely moved from berlios to
launchpad. Both the mailing lists, and the source repository.

The website remains http://yade.wikia.com/

For details see

  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Launchpad_Migration

In short, if you want to keep track of YADE, you need to subscribe:

    https://launchpad.net/~yade-users/+join

This week we are on our way to make 0.20 YADE release.

best regards, and thanks for staying with us!
