<PRE>_ all yade users, please introduce yourself!_

OR YOU WILL BE BANNED! ;-)
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another option, for quasistatic simulations, is to use triangulation or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of the old collider with radiusFactor = 1.2, and update the contact 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list only once per N iterations. Depending on max velocity in the model, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> N can be set to at least 10. You can adjust N during runtime 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically if maxVel increases somewhere. In some very slow 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compression tests, N could really be 50 or so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. But is there such collider written? (I know there are papers
</I>&gt;<i> about that.) What is the computation complexity of triangulation
</I>&gt;<i> collider? I know that the grid-based ones achieve O(N), but we don't
</I>&gt;<i> have that implemented either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Written? Yes, any of the colliders we have would do the job. Just set an 
interval for e.g. insertionSortCollider, and run it periodically with 
detectionFactor = 1.5.
During N timesteps, use the same list of interactions (some will go from 
virtual to real, or real to virtual, no problem with that as long as 
they can change many times).
I experimented that before with the triangulation collider, it worked 
well, but it was not faster than SAPcollider for a stupid reason (*), 
and I realised the same thing could be achieved with SAPcollider with 
intDetectionFactor=1.5.
It needs a few adjustments in other classes now, perhaps, perhaps not. 
For instance, i'm not sure requestDeletion(i) will let &quot;i&quot; become real 
again, but this would be minimal changes.
The problem with CGAL::triangulation is its not parallel.

(*) the triangulation was fast, but iterations on all edges (i.e. 
virtual contacts) was slow, because the data structure has only 
vector&lt;edge&gt; and vector&lt;cell&gt;. There are workarounds but I'm not on that 
now.
Soon however, we will have a triangulation in metabody to simulate flow, 
so I guess it will be time to remove the collider and use the same 
triangulation for flow and contact detection (in our specific problems).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/,">http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/,</A> but there must be more, I am
</I>&gt;<i> quite sure. But you can easily limit current number of threads for
</I>&gt;<i> openMP and allocate those to taucs, or just let the OS do the
</I>&gt;<i> thread-battle by itself. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>We will experiment, thank you for the tip. I'm not so sure a lot of 
algebra libraries with parallel features are available.

&gt;<i> Before, it was the geometry functor deciding on which interaction to
</I>&gt;<i> delete (and there had to be IS2IS4SCGWater), now this responsibility
</I>&gt;<i> shifted to the constitutive law; so it is logical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Note that we stopped using IS2IS4SCGWater after the intFactor was 
implemented in IS2IS4SCG.
I think it is correct to define intFactor in the same law, because 
anybody using more than one physical law between the same bodies would 
have the same problem.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't add it to ElasticContactLaw, however, but to
</I>&gt;<i> ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw (shouldn't it be renamed to
</I>&gt;<i> Law2_Spheres[ContactGeometry]_Elastic[ContactInteraction]_Elastic for
</I>&gt;<i> clarity) and use ConstitutiveLawDispatcher/InteractionDispatchers.
</I>&gt;<i> ElasticContactLaw is nothing but loop around calls to
</I>&gt;<i> ef2_Spheres_Elastic_ElasticLaw with typecheck. Slower and
</I>&gt;<i> non-parallelizable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Good point.

&gt;<i> Oh, BTW, is there agreement on having useShear by default and
</I>&gt;<i> progressively remove prevNormal from various InteractionPhysics classes?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'd prefer to keep the traditional (Cundall) incremental form for now. 
The equations are simpler, especially in 3D, so it is easier to 
understand what happens and implement different laws. I will change my 
mind one day perhaps, but for now I feel like the incremental form is 
good enough for dry friction. :)
