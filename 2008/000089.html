Hi, 

you can look at the engine persistentSAPcollider, this engine update the pair of potential contact by sorting bubble bounding volume method, and then check if the bounding volumes are overlap or not, if yes, the pair of IDs is assigned to the interactioncontainer (transientInteraction in Metabody). Note that they are only potential contacts since only the bounding volumes are checks, and then, pairs of particles are checks again in InteractionGeometryMetaEngine to determine if they are really in contact or not. If they are really in contact, flag isReal in interaction is true and then the contact geometry is built for each real contact.

Hope that I can understand your question clearly,

Take care,

Kien Dang

Subject: [Yade-users] What is the contact detecting method used in YADE?
 
Hi, Dear All,

I am just losting myself in understanding the contact detecting method in a
DEM.
could you please give me some instruction or explaination about what is the
contact detecting method used in YADE?
It is easy to detect if two contacted particles becomes non-contacted again
by check the distance between their center with their radius
sum(radius1+radius2, assume both of them are sphere) because they know each
other when they are in contact an have stored their neighbors relationship
for each other. But, how do you know whether two will change from
non-contacted conditions to contancted condition----because they do not know
each other before then come to contact, do not tell me that you check each
pair in all of the particle---it works but the time cost is toooooo
expensive .

Thanks.
Regards.

Kan
