<PRE>  Hi,

 I use below an example to detail my question:

As written in the mail below there is a nice documentation about how a
triaxial test is performed to current SVN trunk (in
pkg/dem/PreProcessor/TriaxialTest.hpp).
But in this file is described how the code runs but the background
(equations) is not explained, for instance how the displacement of a wall
is computed with respect to the current grain-wall forces (if there is a
stress control).

Can we find somewhere information about the background, for instance for
this particular point, or any other points ?
I know that it is not an easy task to build a documentation, so my
question is not to ask you to make a documentation. It is just to know
whether I have to take time to read the whole code or whether there is a
quicker way to know exactly what is computed by the code ?

  Best,

  Luc


Subject: Re: YADE documentation


&gt;<i> Mr Smilauer: i am starting to use Yade for my PhD research on
</I>&gt;<i> modelling railway ballast for high-speed trains and as you pointed in
</I>&gt;<i> your article, the first dificulty i find is the lack of documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> You mentioned two-half functional articles that i can&#180;t find as the
</I>&gt;<i> links provided are no longer available. Could you please point out or
</I>&gt;<i> send me any documentation you know to that is usefull to using this
</I>&gt;<i> software? I am currently most interested in performing triaxial tests.
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards.

</I>Hi Pedro, (you better ask on yade mailing list
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/yade-users">yade-users at ...</A>, where you will get response for many more
people than just me; moving discussion there.)

It hasn't changed much since time I wrote about lack of docs, but Janek
starts his 2-year postdoc in Grenoble now and he will (I hope) produce
some documentation.

For triaxial tests specifically, it is Bruno who wrote the triaxial test
classes and recently he commited nice documentation on that to current
SVN trunk (in pkg/dem/PreProcessor/TriaxialTest.hpp). I am modifying
TriaxialCompressionEngine now to make it a finite automaton, since I
will use it, too; but that is probably different story. Before you start
to read Bruno's comments on triax, make sure you understand how Yade
works: every iteration is loop over &quot;engines&quot; that operate on bodies in
different ways.

Regards, Vaclav
