<PRE>Hi,

  Why &quot;especially Luc Sibille&quot; ? I'm not sure to be able to help you. In 
addition I am not sure to understand your problem very well.

  When I simulated stress probes with SDEC, maybe I performed something 
similar to your problem. But it was with SDEC!

The general idea was the following one:
- first I created a .txt file: in each row there was a parameter saved 
(for instance, the direction in the stress space of the stress loading)
- Then I included the whole code SDEC in a big loop, like that SDEC 
started and stopped automatically, as many times as wanted.
- Finally each time there was an increment in the big loop defined 
above, the parameter in the row &quot;i&quot; (corresponding to the increment &quot;i&quot; 
of the big loop) of the .txt file was read. The input parameters of SDEC 
were computed with respect to the parameter read.

To do that I used a kind of general engine roughly defined as below:

X axis control:  stress/strain
X stress increment imposed (if stress chosen): 12596
X strain increment imposed (if strain chosen): 0.25

Y axis control:  stress/strain
Y stress increment imposed (if stress chosen): 14157
Y strain increment imposed (if strain chosen): 0.14

Z axis control:  stress/strain
Z stress increment imposed (if stress chosen): 175545
Z strain increment imposed (if strain chosen): 0.75

By this way, for a total stress control for instance, and a parameter 
giving the stress loading direction, the X, Y, and Z stress increments 
were adjusted for each increment of the big loop.

  All that was with SDEC, I don't know at all what would be the solution 
with Yade, but I am sure that it can be much more efficient.

   I hope it helps.

    best

    Luc

Jerome Duriez a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hello everybody (and especially Luc Sibille ?). The title of my mail is 
</I>&gt;<i> surely not very precise so I will try to be clear :
</I>&gt;<i> I want to make succesively different calculations over a sample. That is 
</I>&gt;<i> to say : considering a sample in a given state (a .xml save...) I want 
</I>&gt;<i> to disturb it in a given way (for example compress it), save 
</I>&gt;<i> informations related to this compression, and then go back to the 
</I>&gt;<i> original state (re-load the .xml) and disturb it in an other way (for 
</I>&gt;<i> example : shear it) and again save some things related to this shear...
</I>&gt;<i> Because I want to execute more calculations than one load and one shear, 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm seeking a way to do this automatically. I think that this is 
</I>&gt;<i> impossible with classic engines for example (anyway I don't see how to 
</I>&gt;<i> do this by this way). I imagine for example that in the .xml save could 
</I>&gt;<i> appear an Engine, with a given parameter, which will care to disturb the 
</I>&gt;<i> sample in a direction depending on this parameter but the keypoint would 
</I>&gt;<i> be for me to load this simulation many times with always a different 
</I>&gt;<i> value for the parameter of the Engine.
</I>&gt;<i> Does someone have an idea ? Could python scripts (which I don't know at 
</I>&gt;<i> all but it will maybe be the time) help for that ?
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>
