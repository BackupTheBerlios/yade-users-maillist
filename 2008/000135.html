&gt;&gt;<i> Your spheres have some microscopic young's moduli, but due to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disctribution of interactions you get macroscopic modulus that can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different; and I want to compensate that). I want to make sure that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> given a plane, sum of &quot;surfaces&quot; of all interactions (cylinders between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spheres with the radius of the smaller sphere, right?) is equal to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nominal, macroscopic surface of specimen. It depends on sphere radii
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discribution, for sure; perhaps it can be calculated analytically for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regular arrangements. For other cases, the simulated rigidity may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> artificially higher/lower. I haven't tried to quantify that yes, though.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I understand what you mean, you want to compute analytically the 
</I>&gt;<i> macroscopic young modulus as a function of the microscopic young 
</I>&gt;<i> modulus. I am not sure there is currently a general way to do that for 
</I>&gt;<i> random assembly, it is not easy at all. There were formula like that in 
</I>&gt;<i> SDEC: the input was a macroscopic young modulus and SDEC computed 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically the microscopic young modulus attributed to each 
</I>&gt;<i> particles. But in reality it didn't work, the macroscopic young modulus 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted was not reached.
</I>&gt;<i> The formula used were based on a paper from Cambou, but the formula, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think, were valid only for a given fabric corresponding to the ones 
</I>&gt;<i> studied by Cambou.
</I>&gt;<i> You can find more details in the PhD thesis of Sebastien Hentz who used 
</I>&gt;<i> all that to simulate concrete with SDEC (in which there was a radius of 
</I>&gt;<i> interaction greater than 1). In addition maybe you will find help about 
</I>&gt;<i> interaction laws to use etc... in this thesis, unless you have already 
</I>&gt;<i> read it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, I have read it, thanks. I don't want to derive that analytically, I
will plug intput and output into a neural network and train it to give
me right interaction radius to have the same microscopic and macroscopic
modulus (maybe, it is in collaboration) for different distributions - in
some very primitive way at the beginning, though.
