Hi Pedro, (you better ask on yade mailing list
yade-users at lists.berlios.de, where you will get response for many more
people than just me; moving discussion there.)

It hasn't changed much since time I wrote about lack of docs, but Janek
starts his 2-year postdoc in Grenoble now and he will (I hope) produce
some documentation.

For triaxial tests specifically, it is Bruno who wrote the triaxial test
classes and recently he commited nice documentation on that to current
SVN trunk (in pkg/dem/PreProcessor/TriaxialTest.hpp). I am modifying
TriaxialCompressionEngine now to make it a finite automaton, since I
will use it, too; but that is probably different story. Before you start
to read Bruno's comments on triax, make sure you understand how Yade
works: every iteration is loop over "engines" that operate on bodies in
different ways.

Regards, Vaclav

yes, I plan to work on that. To make things faster I need Andrzej
Oszer to finally tell us which documentation template we should buy
for yade. With them writing docs is much faster.

Hi Feng (or Chen?)

I think you can use something similar to this (from CapillaryLaw.cpp) :

 for(  ; ii!=iiEnd ; ++ii ) {
                        int geometryIndex1 = 
(*bodies)[id1]->geometricalModel->getClassIndex(); // !!!
                        int geometryIndex2 = 
(*bodies)[id2]->geometricalModel->getClassIndex();

                        if (!(geometryIndex1 == geometryIndex2))
                                continue;
}

In your case perhaps you need to define a int geometryIndex3 = 
Sphere()->getClassIndex(), then check if (index1==index3 && 
index2=index3); the result will be exactly the same as long as there is 
no box-box interactions.

Did I miss something?
There is some documentation available at http://yade.wikia.com/
If you have some problem, please describe it and people on the mailing list
would try to find the sollution.
It would be helpful for all if you could get acustomed with
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

The generation of balls is made after line 271  of TriaxialTest.cpp :

vector<BasicSphere> sphere_list;
message=GenerateCloud(sphere_list, lowerCorner, upperCorner, 
numberOfGrains, 0.3, 0.75);
vector<BasicSphere>::iterator it = sphere_list.begin();
    vector<BasicSphere>::iterator it_end = sphere_list.end();
           
    for (;it!=it_end; ++it)
    {
        cerr << "sphere (" << it->first << " " << it->second << endl;
        createSphere(body,it->first,it->second,false,true);
        rootBody->bodies->insert(body);
    }


This result in a uniform ditribution between min and max radius (I just 
realized that min/max radii are hardcoded here, they should be included 
in the interface to be modified without the need of recompiling).
For the moment you will have to modify those lines and

There is something written I think. You should checkout the SVN 
repository and look for a "doc" directory (it is a very old version, but 
basic concepts should be there).

Also, I'm sending you a journal paper (unpublished yet) in a separate email.

In :

GenerateCloud(sphere_list, lowerCorner, upperCorner, 
numberOfGrains, 0.3, 0.75);

0.3 is in fact the deviation from mean radius (so minRadius =(1-0.3)*meanRadius and maxRadius=(1+0.3)*meanRadius in the case of a uniform ditribution - the mean radius is computed based on the size of the box and the initial porosity), and 0.75 is the initial porosity (always very high at the beginning since you initially generate a "cloud" with no contacts and then compact it to a dense assembly).

The function GenerateCloud(...) is defined at the end of TriaxialTest.cpp.

Message-ID: <BE1A3E6D6B8F8047B1C72C2F4F3FFC8A01A5C0F6@EXCHANGE2VS4.campus.mcgill.ca>

Hi,

 

I would like to know if it is possible to generate sphere during the
simulation.  It can be significantly reduce the amount of computing
during the simulation of initial condition since each group of spheres
can be calculated separately.

 

Another issue is that if it is possible to deactivate the sphere during
the simulations, as I guess we can change the flag isDynamic in sphere
class and assign some velocity to the spheres. But is there any way to
delete them during the simulation?

 

Thanks in advance,

 

Kien Dang

Hi,

 

One of the advantage of DEM is that we  can observed the force network
as well as some other properties such as coordination number inside the
material. Can anyone give me some hints to draw a force network in YADE?


 

Thank you so much,

For the moment no element deletion, because some interactions in some 
containers would point to non-existent elements. Yes, you need to set 
IsDynamic=false and move them elsewhere.

In the interface, go in "display", and activate the option 
"interacting_geometry", it will draw force network.
If, you have problems with the scaling factor (thikness of branches in 
the network), activate/desactivate the "interaction_wire" option; it 
will set the scaling to a value more relevant for your simulation.

Subject: [Yade-users] Triaxial Test
Message-ID: <4785FF3B.2080805@civil.uminho.pt>

I' ve been reading about yade architecture in order to understand it. If 
I want to change the triaxial test to let the user decide if he wants to 
have various ball radious and the number of balls with radious 1, number 
of balls with radious 2 etc. What should i edit and recompile? I'm not 
requesting the actual code to do that, just what files should be edited 
and how do i recompile them etc.
Best Regards.

You need to edit TriaxialTest.h and TriaxialTest.cpp, then do the same 
as,  for instance, parameter "sphereFrictionDeg". Namely : declare new 
user variables in TriaxialTest.h, define them (default value) in the 
constructor (TriaxialTest::TriaxialTest(...) ), and register them in 
TriaxialTest::registerAttributes().
Just search all ocurences of "sphereFrictionDeg" in both files and you 
will see.

The result of that will be :
1- new parameters will appear in the interface
2- they will aslo be printed in the *.xml file that you get when you 
save a simulation.

    Hello everybody. I afford me to begin 2008 as 2007 finished, with my 
"graphical problems". To make a point about it (it makes indeed a month 
that I didn't write you about it...)  I remind that, after ubuntu 
updates, for me nothing was drawn in the "Primary view" window, because 
of a problem with GLX. As suggested by some of you, the instruction 
/glxgears/ didn't in fact work. Thanks to my office neighbour, I have 
now changed of graphical driver and now /glxgears/ works (with frame 
rate of more or less 1800 FPS ) (I also reinstalled qglviewer and 
recompiled yade).
    But for Yade it is worse : now yade crashes after the window with 
"Generation" and "Save time", when I use a preprocessor, or it crashes 
also as soon as I click on File - New Simulation. Here is written what 
appears in the terminal :

But how? Which engine will class inherit from? Is it the StandAloneEngine?

It works. Thank you so much

Another issue is I am writing a paper about the packing scheme, however, I was not able to find any paper mentioned about the YADE formulas (i.e. contact law, damping, macro-micro relationship, etc.) at WIKI site (in publication section), could you please give me any paper which has a brief introduction of YADE?

The files are in  trunk/pkg/dem/PreProcessor.
After you have modified them, just recompile by typing "scons" (from the 
base directory) and you are done.
Scons will autodetect what files have been modified and will recompile 
the modified files only. It should take around 10 seconds.

That file is somewhere under pkg/dem/....../TriaxialTest.cpp . If not,
it would not compile before at all. VS

Excelent!! I?ll see what i can do later next week! In my instalation folder i can?t find any cpp file, but i have other folder with yade not compile and there i have all of them.

Hi,

I was performing triaxial test, where after isotropic compaction, I
would replace all transient contacts with SDEC persistent links with the
same rigidity. However, the simulation explodes immediately afterwards,
resp. most elements disappear and things go nuts. I though it was
collider that would create transientContacts even for elements that are
persistently linked; I disabled that to no avail.

How do you do that?

Regards,

Vaclav

I never used persistent links, so I have no clue.
Disabling transient contacts sounds a bit strange, since the main point 
of the DEM is to handle creation/loss of contacts. Why not stick with 
transient contacts?

Hmmm, can you have transient contacts with cohesion (traction)? How
would I do uniaxial traction test without persistent links? Or uniaxial
compression without confinement?

You just need the GNU c++ compiler (not sure about other compilers,
maybe they work) and necessary libs. Apart from that, Yade is being run
on 64bit platforms in 64bit mode without any problems AFAIK.

Yes. You must use the DistantPersistentSAPCollider. The only difference 
with PersistentSAPCollider is :

-in PersistentSAPCollider, if overlap<0, then interaction->isReal=false 
and interaction is removed

-in DistantPersistentSAPCollider, if (overlap<0 && 
interaction->isReal==false) then the interaction is removed

This modified collider must be used with 
InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4DistantSpheresContactGeometry (I 
know you love long names!).

In 
InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4DistantSpheresContactGeometry.hpp, 
you can see this comment :

"////This engine is designed to work with the 
DistantPersistentSAPCollider, the go method does not return
///false when an interaction exists - even if there is no overlap."/

So, the value of interaction->isReal is no longer defined based on 
geometrical properties. Instead of that, it has to be defined in the 
contact law, so that isReal==false ONLY IF the interaction is broken AND 
there is no overlap (see CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw).

Example usage in CohesiveTriaxialTest preprocessor.

I think all you need is an interaction law that will set isReal=false 
when contact is broken in traction. I am not sure that my 
CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw is good for you, so perhaps you have to 
write your own contact law (very similar to existing ones in fact, same 
equations but has to set isReal=false after failure).

IMHO, persistent links could be completely removed from Yade.

New names are coming soon, check out the website. A red link in
front. The submitted articles already uses them. And after 6 months
there wasn't any negative feedback. I have sent at least two posts
about this to yade-dev ;-) Now it's too late if anybody has
objections :)

very good. Instead of spatial criterion you are using a physical
criterion. That's how I wanted to make it ;)

they will be.

Hi everybody,

   I am looking forward installing Yade!

I installed ubuntu on my desktop (I found that kubuntu was full of a lot 
stuff I don't need whereas ubuntu seems simpler).
But now I understand that maybe it will be more complicated to run and 
compile yade on ubuntu than with kubuntu (need to install different 
libraries).

 From the archives of the users mailing list I understand that yade can 
work with both linux distributions. But I am very new with linux and I 
don't want to loose time and to try to do something complicated whereas 
it can much simpler.

So which linux distribution do you advice me to use (kubuntu I think)? 
knowing that this is for my desktop but I will also run yade on 
computers dedicated to computations and I would like to use the same 
linux distribution on all the computers.

   thank in advance,

    Luc

Hello Luc :)

You may be right : kubuntu is perhaps the best choice.
However, there is probably no big difference between installation 
processes with Ubuntu and Kubuntu.
Most of us use Kdevelop to edit/compile Yade, and Kdevelop is supposed 
to be part of Kubuntu environment, but you can as well install Kdevelop 
in Ubuntu, so...
If you have no particular reason to choose Ubuntu (the "stuff you don't 
need" is not a problem in any distribution, if you don't need something 
you will not install it...), choose Kubuntu. It will probably have, by 
default, more of the libraries needed by Yade. But if you use Ubuntu, 
those libraries should be easy to install using your package manager 
("synaptic" in Ubuntu) or with aptitude.

Bruno

Hi, GNOME or KDE is a choice between desktop look not between linux
distributions :) kubuntu and ubuntu are in fact the same distribution
(ubuntu) which comes with a different default desktop. For instance
you could install ubuntu and switch to kubuntu by just installing a
package called 'kde'.

Linux distribution is something different, for example you have
debian, fedora, suse, ubuntu, red-hat, centos, slackware, .....
Those are different linux distributions. And ALL of them have GNOME
and KDE (and few others, for instance I'm not using neither GNOME or
KDE, but I prefer a rox + sawfish combination).

If you like GNOME - go with it! There is no technical difference at
all between GNOME and KDE. It's only a desktop look. To understand
the issue you could try xubuntu which uses xfce desktop (instead of
GNOME or KDE). The desktop looks totally different! But it's the same
distribution. You could switch to xfce without reinstalling linux,
just by installing the 'xfce4' package.

There is also a distinction between a session manager, a window
manager and a file manager, and they all together form a desktop
environment of your choice :) Usually they come in bundles like this:

                   m  a  n  a  g  e  r
            session       window       file
-------------------------------------------------
GNOME       gdm           metacity     nautilus
KDE         kdm           kwin         konqueror
xfce        xfce4-session xfwm4        xffm
----        rox-session   sawfish      rox-filer

The last example is my current configuration. But it has NO NAME,
becuase it's custom I tried every possible session/window/file
manager that are out there and I picked the ones I like most. In fact
I am still occasionally using 'konqueror' and more often 'mc' (mc is
my faviourite file manager in fact, but it is not a graphical one, it
works in a text console, so could be a bit unrelated here).

It's possible to work in graphical linux environment (called
xserer-xorg, or for short "X") without a file manager. For instance
if you run only sawfish on your desktop you will be welcomed by
nothing - no bottom panels, no extra menus to distract, just a
totally empty desktop. Not a single icon. This is useful sometimes also.

Are you completely lost now? Well, you have too much choice. And this
choice is NOT RELATED to yade at all! Use whatever desktop enviroment
you like. Yade will work exactly the same.

If you have concrete, you (=I) want to generate links beforehand and
then have both persistent links (breakable cohesion) and collision of
elements that come close to each other during simulation. That's why I
modified PersistentSAPCollider to ignore contacts that already exist as
persistent.

Has no one done that? How about Wenjie, he was doing concrete, right? (I
am seriously thinking about visiting you in 3s, guys, since this sort of
communication is not nearly as efficient as I would like to ;-) )

Message-ID: <45213f870801211129l171d2a5cs69da2382202961f8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, buddies,

I have some questiones.
1. how to get the micro-force from the macro-stress?
As we know,for most of current studies, the concept of stress is used to
describe the stress status. but when we look into the micro level, we have
to convert the macro-stress to descrete force that applied at each particle,
then how to do this convert?

2. what is the calculation process in each time step?
The problem is that, as see the relation ship below,
___\|/____\|/___\|/________
01---02---03---04---05---06...
|   \   |  /  |      |       |      | ...
11---12---13---14---15---16...
|      |      |   /  |   \  |      |...
21---22---23---24---25---26...
...
...
x1---x2---x3---x4---x5---x6...

in which, the number is the ID of a particle,
and "--- " , "/" ,"\" and  "|" between the numbers mean there is a contact
between the particles
"\|/" means force.
assume the 01-02-03-04...is the upper bounday layer, and the force is
applied as shown "\|/".
when the calculation begins, we need to detecte the contact and update the
position of each particles,
now my problem comes:
what is the procedure to calculation and update the particles' information,
you know the force is from up layer, so the first layer ("01-02-03-04...")
should be calculated, then the second layer,and then the third layer.... but
in DEM, the particle is independent to move, so after some time, some
particles in the first layer may move to the second layer and some particles
in second layer may  move to the first layer(other other layer),then how
should I do in order to know which particle should be calculated and updated
first and which should be done later in the same timestep?
For example,
01 has contacting neighbors 02 and 11, in a same timestep, after we have
calculated 01's properties( velocity, position....), we should calculate 02
first, then 03(the neighbor of 02), after the layer of 01-02-03...is done,
then we can step to calculate the 11, which is to say, in a same timestep,
though 02 and 11 are both contacting neighbors of 01, we should calculate
02, and 11 later though 02 and 11 are both affected because of teh movement
of 01. so, how to indentify which particle should be calculated and update
first , and which should be later?
(because it is a dynamic process, so just use the order of  ID  is not  a
way to solve this)

Hope I have described the problem 2 clearly,

Need your help, thanks so much.

The trick is that you have constant positions during the whole timestep,
you calculate forces from all contacts (order doesn't matter, elements
don't move during calculation) and then, before next timestep begins,
there is LeapFrogPositionIntegrator, that calculates displacements based
on velocity, inertia, applied forces, ... and moves elements to the new
position. Obviously, your timestep must be small enough so that you get
convergence.

Subject: [Yade-users] How to get the micro-force from the macro-stress
Message-ID: <45213f870801222158h940302xf6135f5e07117df6@mail.gmail.com>

Thank you, Vaclav,

So the step for this is :
during each timestep, the position of each particle/element keeps the
same, so we can calculate the force brom the force-displacement
relationship(in this case, the order does not affect the calculation since
all the particle/elements do not move), after we get the forces, we use this
forces to calculate the acceleration, and then the velocity(average
velocity),  and then the movement/displacement in this timestep, and then
update the position of each particle/element to new positions by add
movement/displacement to current position. (until now, the calculation cycle
of this timestep is completed)
then go to next timestep by use the new positions of particles/elements as
the current position to do the next calculation cycle.

is my understanding right?



Thanks again.

Exactly right. What you describe here is the centered second order 
finite diffence scheme (also called leap-frog), which is used in Yade. 
It is probably the most common (and most simple) scheme in DEM codes. 
Other schemes may be possible but are not implemented.

Subject: [Yade-users] YADE crash when spheres generated during simulation
Message-ID: <BE1A3E6D6B8F8047B1C72C2F4F3FFC8A49AD11@EXCHANGE2VS4.campus.mcgill.ca>


Hi all,

I am trying to generate spheres during the simulation, when the old group of shpere is stable, a new group of spheres is generated and the stability check is perfrom similarly to the function computeunbalancedforce in TRIAXIAL TEST. YADE however crash whenever the physicalAction class accessed through a pointer. The thread is begin at the operator get() in the share_ptr in boost library. I tried to figured it out in several days but all the attempts failed.

The code is attached hereunder:


Real MeanUnbalanced=0;
	long nBodies = 0;
        BodyContainer::iterator bi    = bodies->begin();
        BodyContainer::iterator biEnd = bodies->end();
        Real f;
        for(  ; bi!=biEnd ; ++bi ) 
	{
        	if ((*bi)->isDynamic) 
		{
            CRASH HERE --------->f= (static_cast<Force*>   ( ncb->physicalActions->find( (*bi)->getId() , ForceClassIndex).get() )->force).Length();
                	MeanUnbalanced += f;
                	if (f!=0) ++nBodies;
                }
	}
        if (nBodies != 0 && MeanForce != 0) 
	{
		MeanUnbalanced = MeanUnbalanced/nBodies/MeanForce;
	}
        return  MeanUnbalanced;



Could anyone give me some hints about the problems? If you need a whole class please let me know.

Thanks in advance,

Kien Dang

Vaclav, Bruno

Thanks to both of you very much.
Then how about the convertion from the stress to the force on each particle,
where the stresses are from the boundary ?

Subject: [Yade-users] YADE crash when spheres generated during simulation
In-Reply-To: <BE1A3E6D6B8F8047B1C72C2F4F3FFC8A49AD11@EXCHANGE2VS4.campus.mcgill.ca>

One idea comes to mind...
Perhaps the vector containing forces is not resized immediatly to 
(NumberOfOldSphere + NumberOfNewSpheres). So you are accessing component 
(n+...) of a vector of size n.
Perhaps try to run at least one timestep before computing the unbalanced 
force. It can be done by just reordering engines in the loop : place the 
"addSpheres" engine _after_ the "computeForce" engine.

If it doesn't help. Try to decompose this line  :

f= (static_cast<Force*>   ( ncb->physicalActions->find( (*bi)->getId() , ForceClassIndex).get() )->force).Length();

as 

int i = (*bi)->getId();
shared_ptr <physicalActions> pa = ncb->physicalActions->find( 
(*bi)->getId() , ForceClassIndex);
etc...

and see precisely where the problem is.
Also, are you sure that ForceClassIndex is defined correctly? Does it 
work before you generate new spheres?

YADE however crash whenever the physicalAction class accessed through a pointer. The thread is begin at the operator get() in the share_ptr in boost library.

I don't really understand your question. There is no conversion from 
stresses to forces, the conversion goes from forces to stress.
If you find a way to explicitely convert stresses into forces in a 
sphere packing with friction, well... you should apply for the Nobel 
Prize ;-).

Subject: [Yade-users] how to get the force on particle from the boundary?
Message-ID: <45213f870801251157m44bd7381odbf39b7726b94311@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks, Bruno,

I think I did not describe the question clearly.
my question is how to get the force from the force boundary. for example, we
use a rock sample to do the compress test. so we have to force boundary from
the upper face and the the lower face. then how to get the foce on each
grain from the boundary? we will say the force applied on the surface is
1000N, and the area is around 5 square cm, then how to convert the 1000N to
the particle which contacting with the boundary (like a steel surface)?

Regards.

Kan

Thank you so much, the problem is too stupid: I forgot to define the ForceClassIndex.

One idea comes to mind...
Perhaps the vector containing forces is not resized immediatly to 
(NumberOfOldSphere + NumberOfNewSpheres). So you are accessing component 
(n+...) of a vector of size n.
Perhaps try to run at least one timestep before computing the unbalanced 
force. It can be done by just reordering engines in the loop : place the 
"addSpheres" engine _after_ the "computeForce" engine.

If it doesn't help. Try to decompose this line  :

f= (static_cast<Force*>   ( ncb->physicalActions->find( (*bi)->getId() , ForceClassIndex).get() )->force).Length();

as 

int i = (*bi)->getId();
shared_ptr <physicalActions> pa = ncb->physicalActions->find( 
(*bi)->getId() , ForceClassIndex);
etc...

and see precisely where the problem is.
Also, are you sure that ForceClassIndex is defined correctly? Does it 
work before you generate new spheres?

You will not convert anything, you could (1) apply 1000N on the top 
plate, the top plate would then converge to the equilibrium position 
which will correspond to a force of 1000N exerted on spheres, or (2) 
load the sample at constant strain rate until the force on top plate 
reach 1000kN.

Remember that the total force on a body is already defined somewhere. 
Here, the total force on a plate is simply the sum of contact forces 
exerted by spheres. You don't need to compute anything if all you need 
is to get this quantity. You should check what is done in 
TriaxialStressController perhaps.

Or perhaps I still don't understand, and what you need is analysing 
forces one by one, in that case you'd have to traverse all contacts in 
the simulation and check which of them are sphere-plate contacts.

Hi all,
I have some questions.

1. Has someone experiences also with PFC (FISH)? Or better to say are there (YADE) advantages in comparison to PFC? What about the speed of simulation?

I think cannot answer all  four questions, but I can say sth about the 1st question. It depends on what kind of simulation you want to perform, in a way, I think YADE has a better GUI with OpenGL interface than the current version of PFC (ver3.1), for calculation, at least I have evidence that YADE and PFC can yield exactly same results on some very simple verification problems.

Hello

> simulation?
Yes, I worked with PFC before. Yade is probably still a bit slower than 
PFC for the simple basic simulations (perhaps 30% difference but it is 
really hard to get a precise estimate). However, you can slow down PFC 
computations a lot when you start to develop complex fish procedures, 
e.g. in order to make something that was no intended by design. Yade can 
be designed for your own purpose, that is the difference.
> 2. Are in YADE materials for ceramics implemented? Plasticity?
It depends what laws you need for ceramics... Yade has 
elasto-frictional-cohesive contacts, with or without bending moments. 
Thats all for the moment, but you can implement your own constitutive 
relations.
> 3. It is possible to have different contacts in one body?
I would say yes, but I am not sure what you mean here. But anyway, 
everything is possible in Yade if you code it.
> 4. What hardware is recommend?
Any hardware you can install linux-debian on.

Message-ID: <BE1A3E6D6B8F8047B1C72C2F4F3FFC8A49AD14@EXCHANGE2VS4.campus.mcgill.ca>



hi all,

Is it possible to ignore spheres in calculation? As I understand, when isDynamic is set to false, the program still consider the spheres into calculation (calculate force, moment etc) but the accelerations as well as the velocities are not set by the Newtonlaw, is the only way to not consider element in calculation not to assign bounding volume to it??? If yes, can I delete bounding volume during the simulation and how?

Thank you so much,

Kien Dang

  Hi,

 I am beginning to play with Yade, that's really nice, you did a good job!

My question is about the access to yade subversion:
I cannot download subversions. My university locks a lot of things, it
seems that I am not allowed to use svn protocol (svn://). To test the
configuration of the software subversion, I tried to download a subversion
of doxygen (always with the software subersion) using a https protocol
(https://) and it works.

Thus my question: is there another way to access the yade subversions
without using the svn protocol ? (I found a similar question in the mail
archives but I didn't found any answers ;-)
Currently I check the subversion with my web browser through the address:
http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/yade/?sc=0
but it is not efficient at all!

  Thanks

  Luc

Message-ID: <45260.172.20.10.61.1201685256.squirrel@webmail.univ-nantes.fr>

  Hi,

 I use below an example to detail my question:

As written in the mail below there is a nice documentation about how a
triaxial test is performed to current SVN trunk (in
pkg/dem/PreProcessor/TriaxialTest.hpp).
But in this file is described how the code runs but the background
(equations) is not explained, for instance how the displacement of a wall
is computed with respect to the current grain-wall forces (if there is a
stress control).

Can we find somewhere information about the background, for instance for
this particular point, or any other points ?
I know that it is not an easy task to build a documentation, so my
question is not to ask you to make a documentation. It is just to know
whether I have to take time to read the whole code or whether there is a
quicker way to know exactly what is computed by the code ?

  Best,

  Luc

Hi Pedro, (you better ask on yade mailing list
yade-users at ..., where you will get response for many more
people than just me; moving discussion there.)

It hasn't changed much since time I wrote about lack of docs, but Janek
starts his 2-year postdoc in Grenoble now and he will (I hope) produce
some documentation.

For triaxial tests specifically, it is Bruno who wrote the triaxial test
classes and recently he commited nice documentation on that to current
SVN trunk (in pkg/dem/PreProcessor/TriaxialTest.hpp). I am modifying
TriaxialCompressionEngine now to make it a finite automaton, since I
will use it, too; but that is probably different story. Before you start
to read Bruno's comments on triax, make sure you understand how Yade
works: every iteration is loop over "engines" that operate on bodies in
different ways.

Regards, Vaclav

It's hard to say. The given command works for me. I think you should
cooperate with your netadmins to solve the problem.

Additionaly, you can try to checkout the repository using https:
svn checkout https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk
also works for me.

Hi,

I remember that Luc Scholtes had the same problem. It turned out that
his network was badly configured. He was accessing web pages through
proxy, but the gateway was not defined. 

See into file /etc/network/interfaces if there is a gateway defined.
Ask your admin what is your gateway and check if correct IP is
written there. He can verify other values in that file also.


Also, there is a daily snapshot of SVN that you could download:

  http://download.berlios.de/svndumps/yade-repos.gz

but it's not the same as SVN checkout, unfortunately. It is whole SVN

Better if you check your network configuration, instead of using that

The file /etc/network/interfaces is well configured.

svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk
doesn't work (I think because the port 80 is locked)

But:
svn checkout https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk
works with svn, of course, and kdesvn!
(first, I didn't try this address because I thought that a login and a 
password were requested as detailed here

  Many thanks

Hi,

 First, I am discovering Yade, so I think I will have a lot of questions...

By looking the structure of the file called scene.xml (created, for
instance, by the generator TriaxialTest), I understand that in the same
file are defined  the media (the bodies, here spheres) with the
geometrical and physical (or mechanical) properties and the simulation
that we want to perform (with is specific parameters).

My problem is the following one: a given simulation is linked here to a
given media, so can we do different simulations from a unique given media
? I give an example here after based on a triaxial test:

I perform an isotropic compression, after I stop the simulation and save
the result. I don't go further because I want to do different things with
this consolidated granular assembly.
Then I want to do a compression and an extension both from the state of
the media after the isotropic compression. So I perform a first simulation
(the compression) by using the consolidated granular assembly (the result
saved), then I perform a second simulation (the extension) by using the
consolidated granular assembly (always the same result saved).
I imagine that I cannot do that with Yade since the kind of simulation is
saved in the scene.xml file and reused (here the simulation "isotropic
compression" is saved and reused whereas I want to perform a "compression"
or an "extension").

Am I right ? What would be the different steps (in few words) to perform
the simulations described above?

  Best,

   Luc

I developped the TriaxialCompressionEngine, precisely, to solve the 
problem that you explain here.
This engine can still be made a lot more versatile. But, its purpose is 
to handle transitions between different loading paths, and to be easily 
configurable by editing the xml.
If you edit the xml, and - for instance - change manually the value of 
sigma_iso, the packing will converge to a different confining pressure. 
If you play with other flags/values you can also fix some walls, or 
launch a compression test (or extension if the strain rate is set negative).
If you want to simulate some loading paths and you think you can't with 
the current engine, it means you have to code some new features in 
TriaxialCompressionEngine source code (example : proportional strains 
test). In that case, I suggest that you tell me what you need to do and 
we decide how to implement it (which should be relatively easy based on 
what already exists). Note that, at the end, you (or me) can commit the 
change to svn.

Remark1 : TriaxialCompressionEngine can, by default, compress a packing 
and start a compression test when the assembly is dense and stable. You 
can run a first simulation in compression, then edit the intermediate 
file that is saved at the end of the compaction stage, change  
strainRate=x to strainRate=-x, and run the extension test.

Remark2 : The save/edit/modify/load procedure is not exactly 
user-friendly... It would be usefull sometimes to change the loading 
path, or anything else, in real time, in one simulation. Va?lav is 
developping something to do this from a command line. It probably works 
already. It means that we can completely avoid the load/save operations 
if we use this feature.

Remark3 : Va?lav is also working on the triaxial engines now for his PhD 
research, so he will probably participate in the future discussions 
about this. Janek is also starting to use those engines for simple 
compression (no lateral stress) on snow. I guess you just dived in at 
the right moment. :)

Hi, Luc

I did exactly this kind of simulation procedures as you mentioned in the 
question! Yade is almost enable to do the simulation as you want, one 
need just to program it!

Instead of saving the file in scene.xml format, i saved only the 
position and the radius (in a *.txt file) of each element at the end of 
the consolidation, and i stopped the simulation! I called this step as 
"numerical specimen generation"!!

Then reload the saving files (positions and radii of the elements), one 
can make simple compression (or tension) test, triaxial test..etc!!

To do that, i have three different triaxialtest_version -- 
triaxial_for_specimen_generation, triaxial_for_unaixial, 
triaxial_for_triaxialtest!!

This may not be the best solution, but it works(and it might be quite 
similar to the previous procedure done in SDEC)!!

regards

wenjie

Hi everybody. Here are a few pages of documentation about Yade that I 
wrote these last days. As you will see it is quite basic : the goal was 
to explain to someone who begins just to work with Yade (my case not so 
long ago) how to deal with it. So I'm afraid that this could not be very 
useful for the most of you, but maybe for the less experienced or for 
your colleagues that will begin to work with it...

Thank you Jerome, it is very useful. The .pdf is a bit big for a
mailing list, so I hope that it didn't strain too much network
connection of other people here.

I think the best would be to upload it to our wiki page.

Jerome,

you don't need to edit scons.config. If you run

    scons exclude=lattice,mass-spring optimize=1 debug=0 version=-trunk
PREFIX=/opt

then all the options will be written to scons.config and therefore
remembered for the next run. exclude=none is the default, so no need to
bother.

Very nice for the rest, I am sure it will be useful!

    Thank you for your remarks (Vaclav you learned me something ;-) ). 
For the (good) idea of Janek putting this file on the web site, I've 
just made it by using the "Upload file/image" link, but I'm not sure 
I've made it very well : after uploading it I could only refind it in 
the list of "Recent Changes" (from the "Wiki" part of the left of the 
page) : http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Recentchanges, or also in the 
"Gallery of New files" (link in the "Special Pages" from "Wiki Toolbox" 
part) : http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Newimages.
    Maybe are there more suitable locations... So if someone can better 
than me use the wiki, feel free to move this file.

Because they are not walls, they are boxes with finite 
length/depth/thikness and mass. They can be dynamic, unlike the "walls" 
we use usually, which are infinite planes (they can also have contacts 
on each of 6 faces).
We should implement infinite walls in fact, as they would take less time 
for contact detection.

In ElasticContactLaw.cpp, why the code with 'approximated rotations' 
is used, or in other words, is there a particulier reason to comment the 
code with 'exact rotations' ?

"Approximated rotation" is much faster (this is Janek's work). Having 
the exact version commented (rather than nothing) is good, so you can 
always switch to exact rotations by commenting/uncommenting each method 
and benchmarking.

Going back to marking students, so borring!...

Hi,

  From MetaBody::moveToNextTimeStep I understand that during a

Then, if I consider two engines, for instance the GravityEngine and 
another one, that we can call MagnetEngine (we imagine that grains are 
influenced by a magnet field!), each of these engines loops over all the 
bodies. So for one time step I loop twice (in this case) over the body 
assembly.

My question: is there a way, with the current code, to avoid that?
For instance am I allowed to create an engine doing a loop over all the 
bodies and calling inside the loop, for each body, the engines 
MagnetEngine and GravityEngine.

Thanks for your answers,

   Luc

What you suggest would work (some would call it a "hack" though...), 
except that you need at least two engines : one for loops on bodies and 
one for loops on interactions.
Not sure how much time it would save, I'm really wondering too.

You would need more, since typical scenario mixes loops over bodies and
interactions like this:

(0. reset physical actions, increate time by dt etc.)
1. loop over bodies: create bounding boxes, collide them, create contacts.
2. loop over contacts: create interactionGeometry and interactionPhysics
for them; use some material law to deduce forces on bodies in interaction.
3. loop over bodies: to apply other forces (gravity etc), get
accelerations, integrate and displace.

The module spherical-dem-simulator (which I never used): non-modular
spherical DEM that could be benchmarked against the same scenario with
regular engine-based architecture. Since Bruno said we are like 30%
behind PFC for dem (which I would think is monolithic), I would be
inclined to attribute those 30% to modularity.

Message-ID: <BE1A3E6D6B8F8047B1C72C2F4F3FFC8A49AD1D@EXCHANGE2VS4.campus.mcgill.ca>

Hi all,

I am currently implementing the NBS and MR contact detection algorithms, since the cell should be big enough for the largest element. I intent to divide all the bodies into 2 group: spheres and boxes. Then, the contact detection is performed over the spheres. The problem arise when I need to detect contact between box and sphere. Is there any other way than to loop over all the spheres and boxes?

Btw, I dont know exactly what algorithm is used in PersistentSAPCollider and is it faster than the NBS when I look at the code, it seems that the sorting algorithm was employed (not sure yet)
THank you so much,

Kien Dang,

what is NBS and MR contact detection? Is it some sort of grid collider?

This will be extremely useful for everyone here if you send us the
code to add it to repository. We are seriously considering to start
giving more people svn acces, so that everyone can contribute their
own code with much less hassle. Just some permission access details
must be looked into.

Also - if code written by you: the yade users, is added to svn
repository - it is automatically converted (by us, the developers) to
work with latest yade version. You *will* like this feature, because
yade is going to evolve.
If you have your own code, which you don't share by adding it to SVN
you will not want to make an upgrade to new yade version, since your
code will stop working with new version....

I have explained this algorithm in the past, have a look in the
archives (and also this explanation should be put into wiki...)
Look at other posts in thread also, I just did a 'grep collider' on
my inbox archive.

  http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/yade-users/2006q4/000363.html
  http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/yade-users/2006q4/000427.html

Only a short paragraph, starting with "In DEM contact detection is
Sweep and Prune collider ....":

  http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/yade-users/2006q4/000353.html


you could try searching the archive to find more relevant posts. I
just made only a quick search.

best regards

IIRC NBS is the no-binary-search alogrithm by Munjiza.

Bubble-sort of minima and maxima (fast, since arrays are remembered
accross iterations and change only slightly) of
AxisAlignedBoundingBoxes, then it detects overlaps.

True, but no sorting involved in this algorithm, so I think it faster than any sorting involved algorithm. 
I almost done with the NBS, then I will send it to you to submit to svn since I dont have right to modify the reposity.

In fact, I think about that because it is what is done in SDEC. For the
bodies you need at least two engines: one to apply perturbations in
forces (called before the application of the Newton's law) another one
to apply perturbations in positions (called after the leap frog 
integration).
If you want to apply perturbation in body velocities you also need an 
engine called between the two steps of the leap frog integration.

I didn't think about interaction so far.

But maybe a loop over 10,000 bodies is very fast and it would be 
useless. I remember, we spoke about that with Janek in the first time of 
Yade and he was not very worried by this multiplication of loop.

Please, do not think that I am saying that it's bad, and that you have 
to change something. It is just to be sure to really understand how Yade 
works and what I can do with ;-)

I agree with you, it would not be so simple and there are loops that you 
cannot merge as you said.

Message-ID: <47B07EED.1080806@arcig.cz>

Hello,

I just commited changeset that removes the
dispatcher->add(string,string,string) function from
MetaDispatchingEngine, like
    
engine->add("InteractingSphere","InteractingSphere","InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry")

All EngineUnits (like InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4...) declare
types they dispatch for using FUNCTOR1D or FUNCTOR2D macro in the
header. I adapted all FileGenerators to that change and verified they
compile (if I made a typo, it will be a runtime error, though).

Hence, the above example will now take on of the following forms:

 1.
engine->add("InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry")
 2. engine->add(new
InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry)
 3. engine->add( [ the same, but with shared_ptr to that type ] ).

Hope that will make creating engines on the rootbody a lot more readable.

Hello everybody. I am focusing about the "RotationEngine" (in

does, so I have for instance one simple question :

- which is the purpose of the line 
"/rb->se3.orientation.ToAxisAngle(ax,an);/" ? I think I understand what 
it does : it affects to the 3-real vector "/ax/" and the real "/an"/ 
(both declared few lines above) respectively the axis and angle of the 
rotation corresponding to the quaternion "/orientation/".
But why ?
These "/an/" and "/ax/" seem indeed never to be used after that...
Thanks

Oh, don't worry. You only install subversion package on you computer
and look at:

http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Quick_subversion_tutorial

If you really don't want to, then you can send me your files to that
email address you used today.

But at least please make sure that they work with latest SVN version
(SVN-HEAD). And it's already a bit different from latest yade
release. You can download SVN-HEAD with commands shown in above
"quick subversion tutorial".

If you have any problems with making your code to work with SVN-HEAD,
just ask - we will help ;-)

It does not affect ax and an. The se3.orientation is built from
axis,angle. This command calculates 3D orientation (rotation) from
two arguments - the axis of rotation, and the angle of rotation
around this axis.

So axis, angle are not used after that, because we don't need them
anymore - we are using se3.orientation built from them.

To understand this better have a look at page 145 of

Hi, Dear All,

I am just losting myself in understanding the contact detecting method in a
DEM.
could you please give me some instruction or explaination about what is the
contact detecting method used in YADE?
It is easy to detect if two contacted particles becomes non-contacted again
by check the distance between their center with their radius
sum(radius1+radius2, assume both of them are sphere) because they know each
other when they are in contact an have stored their neighbors relationship
for each other. But, how do you know whether two will change from
non-contacted conditions to contancted condition----because they do not know
each other before then come to contact, do not tell me that you check each
pair in all of the particle---it works but the time cost is toooooo
expensive .

Thanks.
Regards.

sorry, you were right. There is a mistake - that line should be

Hi, 

you can look at the engine persistentSAPcollider, this engine update the pair of potential contact by sorting bubble bounding volume method, and then check if the bounding volumes are overlap or not, if yes, the pair of IDs is assigned to the interactioncontainer (transientInteraction in Metabody). Note that they are only potential contacts since only the bounding volumes are checks, and then, pairs of particles are checks again in InteractionGeometryMetaEngine to determine if they are really in contact or not. If they are really in contact, flag isReal in interaction is true and then the contact geometry is built for each real contact.

Hope that I can understand your question clearly,

Take care,

Kien Dang

Subject: [Yade-users] Compress stuff faster and better
Message-ID: <20080216011104.4d4488ca@szpak>

I will commit soon StaticAttractionEngine (which can compress just
about anything) and derived from it StaticSpheresAttractionEngine
(which works only on isDynamic Spheres).


doxygen comment about it:

Compress stuff faster and better!

Faster compression is done by attracting everything to everything using
classical gravitational equation, related to distance. And assuming that 
everything has equal mass: 
               
              D = 1/r^2,

where D is displacement delta, and r is radius. (Units intentionally do
not add: [meter] = [1/m^2]. For unit correctness just multiply by [m^3] )

Forces are NOT used here. Only displacement value, which is normalized
afterwards, which means that ALL values of D (for each body) are <= 1.
Then all D (for all bodies) are multiplied by whatever returns the virtual
function getMaxDisplacement(MetaBody*). Function doesItApplyToThisBody(Body*)
is used to check if Body should be considered for displacement. This
function can for example check if isDynamic.

This engine should be used at the end of the loop, because it directly
changes position of bodies.

After the compression stage is over, engine should be disabled by
setting active=false;

Uh, in fact it's too slow, for bigger usage. That's because
everything is attracted to everything.

But it can be useful in the initial stage of compression, when we
want to remove the central void.

The risk with such a gravity engine is to obtain non homogeneous 
granular assembly, as with isotropic compression. This is the 
consequence of arching effect developed by a granular assembly (even 
with vanishing inter-granular friction angle).
I think the best is to find a process homogeneous "in nature" as the 
compression by growing grains, or maybe, the Janek's 
StaticAttractionEngine (I have never tried).

yeah in fact I have modified it to attract stuff to single point,
because it's faster - single loop instead of nested loop. So I'll
commit it and you will see...

Message-ID: <45213f870802201611w3f2a8046tb849be7a352ef9e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, Dear All,

I readed the code in PersistentSAPCollider, but I am sad because I found I
can not understand how the program works to find the potential contacts?
could you please give me some hints about the details of the
detectalgorithm? It seems a position of a particle is decomposed to
xBounds,
yBounds, zBounds, then sort it, then compare the x,y,z in these three
xBounds, yBounds, zBounds vectors? but how does it work? I still cannot
understand.

Thanks a lot.

Kan.

Hi, I was recently running (for speed measurements) TriaxialTest with
40000 elements. It took maybe 5 minutes before the simulation started,
then it ran at steady speed. The figure linked below shows #elements and
time per iteration graph, it is nicely linear, so I would expect about 1
iteration / sec with 100000 spheres at my computer (slower than yours).
RAM requirements are negligible, I didn't notice any bump on the RAM
monitor in the panel.
beta.arcig.cz/~eudoxos/temp/yade-triax-speed at Intel-core2duo-1.4ghz.pdf

I didn't investigate what was the cause of the lag at the beginning -
either root body initializers or first run of the SAP collider that has
to fill its bound containers. I may profile that with kcallgrind, but I
fear in that case those 5 minutes would take forever.

Hi,

I also need to do large scale simulation which may need to do around 500,000
for field engineering case. but instead of using YADE I have to develop my
own code to do this, :(.
In my opinion, the CPU computing time is the most important issue in DEM,
while the memory is determined by the total particle number, and you
data-structure design, 2GB can do a lot for a 2D case, for 3D case you may
need more memory. but the momory requirements will not change much when your
total particle number is defined.

hi, Vaclav,
is it possible that the 5 mins used for packing or sample preparation to
fill the container? I just guess, for my case, it takes some time for this
step and then enter the cycling.

Wishes.

Kan

Since Bruno just began hunting bottlenecks, Yade could be useful even
for 5e5 - in the current state, one iteration would take about 5 seconds
(by extrapolation).

No, I was loading that file from .xml and it took that time after
starting the simulation that had been already loaded. I think Janek
(ping Janek ;-) ) could comment on this, the PhysicalAction containers
can take a lot of time to initialize.

Kan, could you install callgring /vallgrind/kcachegrind and run this 
command :

valgrind --tool=callgrind ./yade-svn1258 -n -- -f 
/home/bruno/YADE/data/scene.xml -v 1000 -p -m 2

with scene.xml = your 100k spheres simulation. It will make only two 
iterations then stop, and you will get a nice file in /bin that you can 
open with kcachegrind. It will show which function takes all this time.

And yes, I suspect physicalActionContainer too.

Bruno

p.s. saving/loading in binary format would be faster probably.

well, loading xml is slow (binary is faster). Filling PhysicalAction
can be slow too - but currently it's Bruno who currently knows the
best. He is now doing some heavy profiling, I must read carefully his
results.

I can send you the callgrind outputs if you like Janek, or drop them on 
your pc via usb ;-)

Subject: [Yade-users] Problems with save/load
Message-ID: <47C6852A.7000202@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello everybody. For recently I face new problems with Yade : after 
saving the state of a calculation (with .xml file) it happens 
(frequently but not always ???) that I can't load the corresponding save 
file : a small "Yade message" windows appears in the GUI indicating that : .
"/*Bad Attribute value (bad lexical_cast), Tag: "engines", Attribute: 
"active", Line: 34*/" for example.
NB : the number of line changes from an attempt to the other (but for 
the same file to load...)

Please note that this error happens even if I didn't modify at all the 
.xml file issued from the save.
Did anyone face also this problem ?
Thanks

Jerome

The solution has just been given to me by an other PhD of my lab. I 
afford me to make a new mail for everyone :
- the problem was that the save gave wrong values (which correspond to 
nothing) to some attributes of engines : for exemple here in my case I 
had in the save file
"<engines _className_="ElasticCriterionTimeStepper"  active="/_*3*_/"/>"
/ whereas this attribute is a boolean... and was equal to 1 at the 
beginning of the calculation.
     So if you encounter this problem you just have to identify the 
"wrong value" and correct it and you will have the possibility to use 
the results of your one-day calculation...

It must be a serializer bug, since a boolean attribute has values only 0
or 1.

Thanks, Bruno,

I am sorry for the later reply.
I have to write my own code for my project, that is why I always asked you
nice guys some details in DEM or YADE.
Of course I also read the code of YADE, but it is a big project with many a
good design, but it is complex for me, that
is to say some times I can not understand, :(.


Thank you guys again.

Kan.

Hi All,
I want to use different particle size,like 2 mm - 6 mm.Is it possible in YADE to consider different particle size?

If I want to change particle shape like ellipsoid(Example, ELLIPSE 3D),what types of changed I have to made in YADE?

Any idea will be appreciated.

Hi, 

the first one should be easy, try SDECSpheresplane, select max radius(or diameter) 6 and min radius 2, if you are not seeking a complicated particle distribution function.
the second one is difficult, I think you need to create your own element with its correlating constitutive models and a lot of coding involved...

Yes, that would be quite complicated - think only contact detection of 2
ellipsoids in 3d. I would suggest in that case using clumps (rigid
aggregates) of 2 or more spheres that would overlap in such a way that
the overall share would more or less approximate what you need.

For the different particle size: have a look at TriaxialTest, it
generates spheres at random of diameter .5 and 1.5 IIRC.

Below is a paper explaining of detect contact between ellipses in 2D:
http://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/IntersectionOfEllipses.pdf

Maybe extents in 3D are possible, or I saw something about the distance 
between 2 ellipses in 3D in the list below:

You would need to write mainly :
- a new data class for storing elipsoids parameters,
- a new engine for defining a bounding box for elipsoids
- a new contact definition engine (like 
InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry, but for 
elipsoids)

I probably forgot few more new classes, but there are the main ones. I'm 
asking Janek to point you to an old thread were this was discussed for 
cylinders.

Hi everyone! Maybe I faced a problem in installing
Yade on Ubuntu 7.10.-It's too slow! It taked 7 hours
but only 7 files were compiled. Is it because my
computer is too old? or some commands should be
entered before "scons PREFIX=/home/''username''/YADE
optimize=1"? Is there any way to make it faster?
 My CPU is P-M 1.4Mhz and memory is 248M.
Thanks!

No, you can keep it as it is. If you don't define an import file name, 
spheres positions will be generated randomly. small.sdec.xyz is usefull 
only if you want to get always the same sample (e.g. for debugging).

You can find documentation on classes and members in the sources (here 
TriaxialTest.hpp).
Alternatively, you can find the same documentation in html format in 
../YADE/trunk/doc/doxygen/html (this html is generated when you compile 
Yade).

I paste here one part of the documentation on TriaxialTest :


/This preprocessor is designed to :
    1/ generate random loose packings and compress them under isotropic 
confining stress, either squeezing the packing between moving rigid 
boxes or expanding the particles while boxes are fixed (depending on 
flag "InternalCompaction").
    2/ simulate all sorts of triaxial loading path (there is however a 
default loading path corresponding to constant lateral stress in 2 
directions and constant strain rate on the third direction - this 
loading path is used when the flag AutoCompressionActivation = true, 
otherwise the simulation stops after isotropic compression)/
>
> >>What are the function of _maxMuliplier_ and _finalMaxMultiplier_?

Parameters of internal compaction.

> >>What are the function of _default Dt_:

Define dt when an automatic value can't be computed.

>  
>

Those parameters are explained in the sources (at least in latest 
versions). Just check where they are declared and you'll know what they 
mean. Or browse html doc.

Message-ID: <20080310034011.79efcdf0@szpak>

Hi,

Vaclav had a great idea today on IRC - we should make up some list
with what stuff is most important to fix. I want you to add there
things which you consider important. When the list grows big enough
we will start the voting phase.

See on the bottom of:

http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Development_schedule


After the voting, people will offfer who does what (presumably
scratching his itch). I don't think there will be many volunteers for
writing documentation ;-p


thanks.

I had some ideas on that, but it is not possible currently - we would
have to change the collider and some things here and there. The code
never saw the light of the day, however (not yet?).

http://beta.arcig.cz/~eudoxos/phd/index.cgi/YaDe/PeriodicBoundary

What kind of periodicity do you need? Simple cartesian? Cylindric?
Cylinder section?

It would be for the simulation of a direct shear test. I had the idea 
soon by reading an article where such simulations were presented and 
periodic boundaries were used so that the boundary effects of lateral 
walls disappear. So I guess that it would be what you call "simple 
cartesian" periodic boundaries (I didn't know these different types even 
if I think guess to what they refer). Thank you for your answer

Actually, the doxygen documentation should be the documentation base.
I know Vaclav is writing precise and complete comments in doxygen style 
in his classes, I started to do the same in some classes, and if you 
browse dox-doc a bit you realize that it works well.
One big advantage of this is that there is not ONE guy to write the 
documentation, but many.
Even the average user trying to understand a class can comment a 
variable with "/// comment on x...", when he finally found the meaning 
of x. Then, after commit, it will update the documentation immediatly.

The conclusions are :
-Encourage all users to comment the code if they can.
-Encourage them to commit to svn (yes if more users commit stuff, there 
is a bigger chance of breaking things, but considering that currently 
most users are so afraid of commiting something wrong that they commit 
nothing, I think self-control is strong enough and we can encourage them 
to commit a bit more - and anyway subversion is designed in such a way 
that it's impossible to really break Yade).

For all users :

-The simplest "doxygen style" comment in a .hpp file is with 3 slash bars :

class something
{

/// Description of x
int x;

}

and it will result in x being listed, with the comment, in the doxygen 
documentation about class "something".


For a more general description of a class, it is almost the same idea : 
type the comment just before the declaration of the class, but for a 
multiline comment, use " /*! " instead of " /// ", as in clump.hpp below.


/*! Body representing clump (rigid aggregate) composed by other existing 
bodies.

    Clump is one of bodies that reside in rootBody->bodies.
    When an existing body is added to ::Clump, it's ::Body::isDynamic 
flag........
    .....
 
 */

class Clump: public Body {

....

}

Hello,

I'm currently trying to use clumps within my DEM simulations of granular

Has anyone already used them in simulations ? Did you encounter problems 
? If you could share you experience I would be happy ...

Personaly I didn't have worries, but I didn't do much too :-)

Thanks

My version is yade-0.11.0

My only confidence in that code comes from the fact that

1. I tried to scrutinize the code as much as I could (no cut&paste of
things I didn't understand etc),

2. I run some simulations to see whether is conserves energy (it seemed
that it indeed does); that code is in #ifdef 0 prison in Clump::moveMembers;

3. clumps in ClumpTestGen behave rather realistically.

Apart from that, I can't give you any guarantees, but you will have the
honor to use that code for a real simulation ;-). In any case I am here
to help you out or fix things if something is broken.

IIRC there were no changes to clump code since 0.11. (We could make
another "stable" release before Janek goes berzerk with
boost::serialization and the whole project collapses - ping ;-) ).

Best, Vaclav

I had to implement interaction radius factor for spheres that is >1
(i.e. create contact even if the spheres don't physically touch). There
is
InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry::interactionDetectionFactor,
but for it to work, it also needs larger AABBs so that the collider will
request the contact to be created. For now, I added
InteractingSphere2AABB::aabbEnlargeFactor, but I think there must be

Hello

Luc did that before for capillary forces.
I just checked what is used in TriaxialTestWater :

in TriaxialTestWater.cpp :
/boundingVolumeDispatcher->add("InteractingSphere2AABBwater");
/
and in InteractingSphere2AABBwater.cpp :

/aabb->halfSize = 
Vector3r(1.5*sphere->radius,1.5*sphere->radius,1.5*sphere->radius);/

He hardcoded the "enlargeFactor".

Appart from that, I don't think you missed anything in existing code, 
and I agree that you have to add this new data in body2AABB.

The problem is that the users will have to remember to modify the factor 
simultaneaously in both classes...

Also, note that in some cases (in mine in fact :)), 
InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry::interactionDetectionFactor 
will be more than one while Body2AABB::interactionDetectionFactor will 
be 1. The typical situation for that is a cohesive contact, which will 
break in tension in a "distant" situation, but will be created ONLY IF 
there is a real (not-distant) contact at the beggining.

You can set PersistentSAPCollider::haveDistantTransient=True and it will
not delete interaction even if there is gap between spheres (your
constitutive law is responsible to delete the interaction, if wanted).
If I get it right, setting >1 for *2*4*Geometry and having regular AABBs
will make the behaviour non-isotropic, since in diagonal directions
spheres will be collided earlier (as soon as dist<(sqrt(2)*(r1+r2))),
while in the axial directions, that will happen at dist<(r1+r2). Unless
you handle that specially in *2*4*Geometry, you will have more diagonal
contacts being created and they will be distant.

In my case, I will set those sphere factors to >1 for first few
iterations, so that cohesive contacts are create between particles that
are initially close together (i.e. that are "structural", not just
coming together during simulation) and then, I reset those to 1 and
create non-cohesive contacts.

The interaction of engines is getting complicated, I will (perhaps) try
to document that. We should say for good who is responsible for deleting
contacts (I think constitutive law, not the collider) and rename the
isReal flag to seomthing more meaningful (like isPenetrating).  Would
you agree with that? (Luckily, persistentInteractions will die soon.)

Janek, is there a guarantee that I can do

 for(InteractionContainer I=ic->begin(); I!=ic->end(); ++I){
    /*...*/
    ic->erase((*I)->getId1(),(*I)->getId2())
 }

without invalidating the iterator I (and crashing or whatever)?
(Currently I push interactions to be deleted into a
std::list<pair<bodyId_t,bodyId_t>> and then iterate over that, once the
loop over interactions is finished.)

Message-ID: <47E8A937.2070004@arcig.cz>

Hello,

I would like to quantify how much has a simulation approached static
state (provided such state exists). Has someone done that? I thought of
summing velocity norms (but what should be the threshold here?) or
perhaps observing whether global stiffness is almost-constant. (Bruno,
you're expert on that, how would you do that?)

The reson for that is to programatically stop simulation once desired
state is reached, without user interaction, so that I cun say: run that
until it is done.

Hi Vaclav,

   The simplest way is to check the kinetic energy of the whole granular 
assembly and stop the simulation when the kinetic energy is low enough 
(a given percentage in addition of the lowest kinetic energy computed 
after a long time of simulation without evolution of the loading 
parameters).

   Otherwise something is already implemented for the triaxial test and 
based on the unbalanced force of the particles. But Bruno will speak 
about that better than me!

   Best,

   Luc

Ah, you are right. I told you something wrong. With cohesive contacts, I 
use InteractionFactor=1 in both engines in fact, but I still need the 
"distant" variant of *2*4Geometry because only this one will update the 
geometry and keep isReal=true for distant configurations.
To make it clear : I never create distant interactions, but I can delete 
distant interactions; in that case I use "distant"  engines with 
radiusFactor=1. And it should be isotropic...

Ok. It makes sense in concrete (I guess you will define an equilibrium 
position with interpenetration!=0 then?), but - generally speaking, it 
is not necessary to create cohesion between distant bodies in order to 
simulate a cohesive material, cohesion at contacts is sufficient.

Yes, constitutive law should do that.

"isPenetrating"?!! The actual meaning is more "isInteracting" : it can 
be true in distant configurations as long as a cohesive interaction 
persists.
Because of those lines in Interacting2Interacting4DistantGeometry :

if (penetrationDepth>0 || c->isReal)
    {
        ....
   
        return true;
 }

(Remember that this return value is used to define isReal...)

Why do you need to delete them? I though the collider would do that as 
soon as the constutive law set isReal=false.
Line 201 in DistantSAP :

if (overlap && !found)
        transientInteractions->insert(body_id_t(id1),body_id_t(id2));
        else if (!overlap && found && !interaction->isReal)
        transientInteractions->erase(body_id_t(id1),body_id_t(id2));
 
Did I miss something?

Hehehe.
You don't like the "UnbalancedForce" parameter? ;-)

It is exactly what you are looking for, and its already used the way you 
want to use it (switch between isotropic and axial compression)

TriaxialCompressionEngine :

if ( UnbalancedForce<=StabilityCriterion && 
abs((meanStress-sigma_iso)/sigma_iso)<0.005 ) {
if(currentState==STATE_ISO_COMPACTION && autoCompressionActivation){
doStateTransition(STATE_ISO_UNLOADING);

"UnbalancedForce" is a normalized sum of forces on all bodies.
It can be a bit higher than 1 when the system is really far from 
equilibrium (e.g. at the begining of the isotropic compression when only 
peripheral spheres are pushed by boxes), but it is generally between 0 
and 1.
At static equilibrium, it is exactly equal to 0, which of course never 
happen. A reasonable value to consider something is stabilised could be 
between 1% and 0.1%.

Your spheres have some microscopic young's moduli, but due to the
disctribution of interactions you get macroscopic modulus that can be
different; and I want to compensate that). I want to make sure that
given a plane, sum of "surfaces" of all interactions (cylinders between
spheres with the radius of the smaller sphere, right?) is equal to
nominal, macroscopic surface of specimen. It depends on sphere radii
discribution, for sure; perhaps it can be calculated analytically for
regular arrangements. For other cases, the simulated rigidity may be
artificially higher/lower. I haven't tried to quantify that yes, though.

That's right, thanks! This is in persistentSAPCollider:

 if(!overlap && found && (haveDistantTransient ? !interaction->isReal :
true) ) [delete the contact]

(I added the PersistentSapCollider::haveDistantTransient so that the
DistantPersistentSAPCollider can disappear)

If I understand what you mean, you want to compute analytically the 
macroscopic young modulus as a function of the microscopic young 
modulus. I am not sure there is currently a general way to do that for 
random assembly, it is not easy at all. There were formula like that in 
SDEC: the input was a macroscopic young modulus and SDEC computed 
automatically the microscopic young modulus attributed to each 
particles. But in reality it didn't work, the macroscopic young modulus 
wanted was not reached.
The formula used were based on a paper from Cambou, but the formula, I 
think, were valid only for a given fabric corresponding to the ones 
studied by Cambou.
You can find more details in the PhD thesis of Sebastien Hentz who used 
all that to simulate concrete with SDEC (in which there was a radius of 
interaction greater than 1). In addition maybe you will find help about 
interaction laws to use etc... in this thesis, unless you have already 
read it.

Yes, I have read it, thanks. I don't want to derive that analytically, I
will plug intput and output into a neural network and train it to give
me right interaction radius to have the same microscopic and macroscopic
modulus (maybe, it is in collaboration) for different distributions - in
some very primitive way at the beginning, though.

Subject: [Yade-users] get SVN access - give us your code!
Message-ID: <20080325121538.5b55d846@absurd>

Hi,

We want yade to grow quickly. The best way to do that is to allow
users to add their code to SVN. There are plenty of people around who
made their own engines and generators but didn't bother to share with
others. All yade developers and users want to see the code of other
people, to be able to use it!

If you want a direct SVN access, please create an account on
berlios.de and give us your login name. We will add you to the
project, and you will be able to share your code with others
easily - just commit it to the SVN repository!

There is one important benefit for you also - when refactoring and
name changes happens - your code is converted automatically to
compile with new version of yade. Otherwise you will have to make
this conversion yourself. And yade is evolving quickly, so what
compiles today with yade may not compile next month! Unless, of
course, you add your code to SVN, then we will make sure that your
code always compiles.

There are some people here who I think should get the SVN access, but
if you are not listed, don't hesitate to ask!

Luc Sibille, Lionel Favier, Luc Scholtes - plenty of work from L3S :)

Jerome Duriez - you have found one bug, so best if you fix it yourself :)

Feng Chen - you must have something to share - you have written one paper!

Kien Dang - we want your NBS algorithm!


come on, join us :)

Hi, V?clav:

Currently I think using unbalanced force is the best way to know whether your system is close to equilibrium. 

Using the "velocity norm" appears to be a direct quantity, however, the "velocities goes to zero, or kinetic energy goes to zero" does not equal to the equilibrium state. Consider a mass-spring vibration case, when the velocity is zero for the mass, the acceleration for the mass is the maximum. 

It might be similar to the simple problem when we study basic physics in high school. How to define an object is "static or equilibrium" (Newton's first law)?  Then you would think delta(vel_norm)/t_p = 0, where t_p = a period of time, but it might be difficult to determine your t_p in DEM?

Hi Yade Users,

PFC works quite fine with the unbalanced force approach, which might 
fail when you have a very loose assembly with no gravity.

I think looking at energies is always a good idea, but you should always 
look at the kinetic and the potential energy in the system. If the sum 
goes down you approach equilibrium.

   my two cents

aah, the wiki is out of date. qglviewer was already added to debian lenny, just look:

http://packages.debian.org/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&searchon=names&keywords=qglviewer

if you are on debian lenny you can simply install it with 
  apt install libqglviewer-dev libqglviewer2

if you are on debian etch, you can backport from lenny using instructions on:
  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_of_yade_on_debian_or_kubuntu

If you use SVN trunk (yes, you can, it doesn't crash), qglviewer was
integrated into our tree and our build-system a few weeks ago: then you
don't need to install it at all. Those porting problems were just too
big a pain.

Hi, my fault, that page wasn't up-to-date and the cron script doing
weekly uploads was broken. I think it is fixed now, but I cannot check
for myself. You can always go to the URL
http://geo.hmg.inpg.fr/~smilauer/yade to see what svn revisions are
actually available. The current one is yade-svn1290. If it doesn't
build, let me know, I will fix that.

You must add _source_ package for yade (type is "source", not "binary").
> http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_of_yade_on_debian_or_kubuntu
Mixing these two howtos will not work. The first one builds and installs
debian package, the second one compiles and installs yade without any
package management.

Let me know if you still have problems.

Hi,

I updated dependencies in yade-svn1292. It builds here. The problem with
debhelper seems that you have a version that is too old. Are you running
sarge? (debhelper 5 is in backports). Even then, you will need
libboost-*dev>=1.34 which are in lenny (not in etch). I am sorry for
that much inconvenience... you _could_ use boost 1.33, but you would
have to copy the  foreach.hpp header separately (discussed a few days
ago on this list). If there is big demand for foreach.hpp-less
installations, we can add it to our tree and use it optionally, it is
not a big deal.

Hi, Rana:

If you are building QGLViewer version 2.2.6 from source, when you have finished the make and type "make install" (under root), try another command "make target", I feel there is some error for the "make install" script, and it failed to copy some important files. You may open the script of the "make install" and I believe this error exists not only on Fedora-like linux.

aah, the wiki is out of date. qglviewer was already added to debian lenny, just look:

http://packages.debian.org/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&searchon=names&keywords=qglviewer

if you are on debian lenny you can simply install it with 
  apt install libqglviewer-dev libqglviewer2

if you are on debian etch, you can backport from lenny using instructions on:
  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_of_yade_on_debian_or_kubuntu

the foreach.hpp problem wasn't discussed on _this_ list - it was
discussed on yade-dev. I attached this file to last message in this
thread:

http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/yade-dev/2008/000361.html

And this is why I was wondering that maybe it would be useful to
merge both mailing lists...

Also I feel that Jean Francois Jerrier and Jerome Duirez will have
similar problem because they have just today asked me how to download
svn. But I will wait until they come and ask me.

Since they are "just" warnings: were the DEB packages created in ..
(i.e. yade-svn1292, yade-svn1292-dev and yade-svn1292-dbg)? If yes, did
you try to install and run?

Hello Rana,

You will help a lot if you could update wiki, because you are
currently the only person which precisely knows what needs to be
updated. I would need to spend time to try and find mistakes.

You don't need to register on wiki! Just click "edit", and it will work :-)

thanks a lot

Its the generalized mass. i.e. one mass for each degree of liberty : 
actual mass for 3 translation axis, and inertia matrix for the 3 
rotation axis. Its a bit difficult to uncouple rotational degrees of 
liberty because corresponding "mass" is a matrix...
Cundall proposed to use diagonal terms as an approximation, its what I 
did in GlobalStiffnessTimestepper.

> 2. k here is kn or ks or some other value else?

Again generalized stiffness : a matrix including translational and 
rotational stiffnesses (taking into account all contacts on bodies). And 
again I used the diagonal terms to associate a scalar stiffness to each 
degree of liberty.

Contact created/deleted = stiffness changed.

No, unless you set big security margin, which would mean a waste of time.

Bruno, how does this value compare to critical timestep calculated from
elastic wave propagation speed along the particle calculated for
cotinuum, i.e. , which is 2*particle diameter / sqrt(Young's modulus /
density)? I would assume it underestimates the timestep, but may have
the advantage that it has to be evaluated only once, since contact
stiffnesses are derived (for purely linear elastic contacts) from the
same values.

I use this formula for preliminary estimation of computation time for a
simulation.

Wait a minute, what is "Young modulus" for you?
If it is the real modulus of the spheres, it has no existence in Yade.
If it is the modulus of the packing, it is changing all the time, just 
because contacts are created/lost all the time (from 0 contacts at the 
begining to around 5 per sphere after some iterations).
I don't see how you can compute a constant Young modulus here.

There is a simple way to evaluate if a timestep is good or not :
run the simulation and watch the evolution of unbalanced force (now 8th 
column in WallStresses files generated by TriaxialStateRecorder) while 
you increment dt manualy. When unbalanced force start to tend to a 
constant non-zero value, or even increases more and more, dt is too large.
You will see if your dt could be much larger without any trouble.

Honestly, given that the automatic computation of dt takes less than 5% 
of cpu time, I don't see any interest in using another approximate 
method. It would make sense only if you are sure that your approximate 
dt is only 5% smaller than the automatic one (so that you don't waste in 
extra iterations the time saved by not computing dt). Really unlikely...

Message-ID: <47FA533E.9030004@hmg.inpg.fr>


To anybody using GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper :

The default safety coefficient on dt is 0.25, which means that the 
actual dt in the simulation will be 0.25*(true critical dt).
0.25 is very low. The same value in PFC for instance is 0.8 by default.
We are investigating this with Janek atm, and in my last tests, I could 
run simulation with safety coefficient = 1 without any trouble.
So try modifying this and if you don't see any problem go for less safety.
The same simulation wich need 100 iterations with safety=0.25 will need 
only 25 iterations with safety=1.
This is not a negligeable difference...

I think I will change this default safety coefficient soon, to prevent 
people from using such a conservative value.

Hi

 > Is there any documentation for Spherical Shape particle?

I don't know whether there is documentation in this website for 
spherical particles. But, it is not a problem to detect a contact with 
such a shape. It is enough to compare the distance between the centres 
of the spheres and the sum of the radii of the spheres.
All that is already implemented (for the spheres) in Yade.

   Best,

    Luc

Hi

It is strange that you ask for documentation and give the link to it 
yourself. ;)

What you need is here : http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/index.html,

Look for TriaxialTest in the index and you will have some details on 
what it does and on the meaning of some parameters.
It can also point you to other classes related to this preprocessor, 
which are documented as well.

If it is not enough (which I could understand...) let us know what sort 
of information you are looking for.

Bruno

This link works for me :

 http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/index.html


Scons should also build one local version of the same documentation when 
you compile Yade for the first time.

Thank you, Bruno.
I read the code, and found the code as following.

00055         Vector3r& stiffness = (static_cast<GlobalStiffness*>( ncb->
physicalActions<http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/df/deb/classMetaBody.html#5b485c55dd71687385a781e046e0cf45>->find
(body->getId(),
globalStiffnessClassIndex<http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/d6/d99/classGlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.html#e54a0bd2675dce826ee3f06f636ce1f1>
).get()))->stiffness;
00056 Vector3r& Rstiffness = (static_cast<GlobalStiffness*>( ncb->
physicalActions<http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/df/deb/classMetaBody.html#5b485c55dd71687385a781e046e0cf45>->find
(body->getId(),
globalStiffnessClassIndex<http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/d6/d99/classGlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.html#e54a0bd2675dce826ee3f06f636ce1f1>
).get()))->Rstiffness;

1. Then where is the stiffness and Rstiffness created, and how is it
created, I can not find the file. And what is the physical rules behind to
creat the global translational stiffness and global rotational stiffness?
thanks.

00083         Real dt = max( max (stiffness.X(), stiffness.Y()),
stiffness.Z() );
00084         if (dt!=0) {
00085                 dt =
sqrt(sdec->mass<http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/d2/d85/classParticleParameters.html#c144beb4217eff38a9c0805c1b6ab5b2>/dt);

true;}

2. 1  here, it is sqrt(mass/stiffness), but I did not see like 2* as the
equation I have seen. why the 2 is lost or I am wrong?

00086         else dt = Mathr::MAX_REAL;
00087
00088         if (Rstiffness.X()!=0) {
00089                 dtx =
sdec->inertia<http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/d7/d72/classRigidBodyParameters.html#8e165f286a97c3c1a7bfb0d4e8e703be>.X()/Rstiffness.X();

true;}
00090         else dtx = Mathr::MAX_REAL;
00091
00092         if (Rstiffness.Y()!=0) {
00093                 dty =
sdec->inertia<http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/d7/d72/classRigidBodyParameters.html#8e165f286a97c3c1a7bfb0d4e8e703be>.Y()/Rstiffness.Y();

00094         else dty = Mathr::MAX_REAL;
00095
00096         if (Rstiffness.Z()!=0) {
00097                 dtz =

true;}
00098         else dtz = Mathr::MAX_REAL;
00099
00100
00101         //if (Rstiffness.X()!=0)
00102         //Real dtx = (Rstiffness.X()!=0 ?
sdec->inertia.X()/Rstiffness.X() : Mathr::MAX_REAL);
00103         //Real dty = (Rstiffness.Y()!=0 ?
sdec->inertia.Y()/Rstiffness.Y() : Mathr::MAX_REAL);
00104         //Real dtz = (Rstiffness.Z()!=0 ?
sdec->inertia.Z()/Rstiffness.Z() : Mathr::MAX_REAL);
00105         Real Rdt = sqrt( min( min (dtx, dty), dtz ) );

2. 2 the same question , why only sqrt( ), but not 2 or some other constant
factor.

00106
00107         //cerr << "Rstiffness.x()=" << Rstiffness.x() << "  " <<
Rstiffness.y() << "  " << Rstiffness.z() << endl;
00108         //cerr << "sdec->inertia=" << sdec->inertia.x() << " " <<
sdec->inertia.x() << " " << sdec->inertia.x() << endl;
00109         //cerr << "timesteps : dt=" << dt << " / Rdt=" << Rdt << endl;
00110
00111         dt =
0.709*timestepSafetyCoefficient<http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/d6/d99/classGlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.html#63258ee4705252db25254e49900914dc>
*std::min(dt,Rdt);//0.709 = 1/sqrt(2)

3. here, what is the meaning of 0.709 where sqrt(2)/2, I understand the
"timestepSafetyCoefficient" is for safety purpose, but I cannot understand
the value of sqre(2)/2;

as question 1, how to calculate the matrix that includes translational and
rotational stiffnesses? or where is the function in Yade (or the file)?

 Thanks for your guildance very much.

Hi,
I am facing a silly problem.Any idea will be appreciated---

After running <scons doc>, i am not getting doc,having message like ---
shompa at shompa-desktop:~$ scons doc

scons: *** No SConstruct file found.
File "/usr/lib/scons/SCons/Script/Main.py", line 1128, in _main

but,  just last week I have accessed ...
http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/index.html
now a days..having message like---
<The requested URL was not found on this server.          The link on the     referring     page seems to be wrong or outdated. Please inform the author of     that page     about the error.>

I have also try to access changing the server.

That was not meant for triaxial test, I know I can use unbalanced force
there. (I will probably move that code somewhere else to make it
possible to use it in different simulations.)

The advantage is that it makes a (very rough) estimate without ever
running or even creating the simulation.

Ok... So I really don't know how the two values compare. But I'm 
interested by the result of the comparison.

The fact that dt is less than the critical value is not related to the 
simulation (TriaxialTest or anything else).
The point was just that TriaxialTest is one way to test if an equation 
for computing dt_crit is correct or not.
If your equation is correct in TriaxialTest, it will be correct for 
almost any simulation, and vice-versa (because TriaxialTest includes all 
possible states, from granular gaz to very dense packing, which means 
variations of in a wide range of values).

Good point. We also discussed with Janek a way of computing unb_f 
without additional loops : the mean contact force and the mean forces on 
body could be computed respectively in interaction law dispatcher and 
position integrator, or something like that.
The unbalanced force could even be displayed in GUI with the current 
timestep as it is very usefull in most simulations.

I see. But if it's independant on the density (i.e. number of contacts), 
it will be either far too small in some situations or too large in 
others. I think ElasticCriterionTimestepper was coded with the same idea 
in mind. Not sure it was a big success since people always got dt values 
that were so small that it was like nothing was happening in the simulation.
The only situation where GlobalStiffness is not relevant is when you 
have high speed impacts (problems with high initial velocities) , in 
such case dt_crit depends on the ratio (size of bodies / initial 
velocity) because you don't want bodies to pass through each other in 
one iteration. Still not related with elastic waves...

I see how it compares now, with global stiffness approach we have :

- The stiffness of one contact is proportional to D*E  (D : particle 
diameter, E elastic modulus)
- The mass of one particle is proportional to density*pow(D,3)

So, if a particle has only one contact, its critical timestep (with 
global stiffness approach) will be :
sqrt(mass/stiffness) = D*sqrt(density/E) = your equation.

Advantage :
The underlying physics is the same but your equation is faster.

Potential problems :
-As soon as a particle has two contacts it will explode.
-If shear stiffness is high compared to normal stiffness (unusual 
situation in fact), it will explode.

Conclusion : you need to find a reasonable value for a security 
coefficient to include in your expression.

Hello. It is surely a bit late (...) to help you but I answer for maybe 
other people who will be interested in the same thing in the future.
    So, now there is in the latests versions of Yade an Engine (in 
pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine/) named "ForceSnapshot" you could use 
for save in an output file all the values of normal force of the 
interactions present in the model. I use this output File with Matlab 
then to draw such force networks (spheres of the model with a more or 
less big line between the spheres in contact to represent the value of 
the normal force). My problem is 3D but I ask to Matlab to draw only the 
interacting spheres that are both in a "cut" (that is to say that for 
exemple their Ycenter belongs to [Y0-Dy;Y0+Dy], with Dy similar to a 
mean diameter of your spheres, so that not too much spheres that are 
behind each other are drawn).

Hello

Do you know that you can see force networks in Yade GUI?
I just updated wiki about that. See :

Subject: [Yade-users] Error Message After Launching YADE
Message-ID: <55590.49234.qm@web46015.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,
After launching YADE>Preprocessor>Filegenerator>...having error message in terminal like---
YadeQtMainWindow: Loading configuration file: /home/shompa/.yade-0.11.1/QtGUIPreferences.xml.
Attribute is not defined : outputFileName
Attribute is not defined : serializationDynlib
Attribute is not defined : outputFileName
Attribute is not defined : serializationDynlib

Common Parameter:
>output Library Name: ../data/scene.xml
>output Library Name: XML FormatManager
import filename:
> ../data/small.sdec.xyz

 In my  .. /YADE(bin,data,include,lib...present),but in  "data" folder nothing...may be this is the source of probable error(I guess).

Suppose I want to generate 9 partilce...for this I have to prepare my input file?
But as per reference (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/First_steps)....Filegenerators are used to generate an input file for yade to simulate something.

What is the function and significance of "import File Name"../data/small.sdec.xyz?

Any idea will be appreciate.

Regards,
Rana

So, first, this is not a real error message, in the sense that I had 
also become it, and it never prevent my calculations to run well (when 
they didn't that was not due to this !)

Then, about "import File Name". The idea is that it is a text file 
containing all the informations about the sample you want generate : on 
each line the X,Y and Z coordinates of the center on a sphere, and its 
radius. This informations are read by Yade, stored in a list called 
generally something like "sphere_list" (type "vector<BasicSphere>"), and 
this list is used after to generate really the sample (create the 
bodies). So if you want to generate 9 particle, you have to create your 
own text file with 9 such lines (it's normal you have no 
"small.sdec.xyz" file)

To finish, it should depend on the version of Yade you have, but maybe 
this importFileName is in fact not used (look at the sources to know it) 
: an other method called "GenerateCloud" can be used to create this 
"sphere_list". You have to give to this function the corners of a volume 
to be "filled" with a given number of spheres (with a given porosity 
assumed to be high), and a given "radius standard deviation" (the radii 
are statistically distributed around a calculated "mean value"). But 
there are default parameters in the Preprocessor normally.

Subject: [Yade-users] Dt by GlobalStifnessTimeStepper version 1311 always
	null...
Message-ID: <48038C64.5010601@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello everybody. I begin to try to use values of time step calculated by 
"GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper". But my problem is that it is always null, 
as the followings lines which are displayed on the terminal show it :
"INFO  
pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine/GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.cpp:187 
computeTimeStep: computed timestep 0, appplied.
INFO  pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine/GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.cpp:187 
computeTimeStep: computed timestep 9.72989e-06, BUT timestep is 0.
INFO  pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine/GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.cpp:187 
computeTimeStep: computed timestep 9.72989e-06, BUT timestep is 0.
INFO  pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine/GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.cpp:187

INFO  pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine/GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper.cpp:187 
computeTimeStep: computed timestep 9.72989e-06, BUT timestep is 0."

I began to give a look to the code and it seems to me that all that is 
normal... That is to say that it seems that at the first calculation a 
null time step was calculated and applied, and then this value was 
always kept.
I think that it is because of this line, which I have in my version 
(1311) and that some others students of my lab with older versions don't 
have :

"previousDt = min ( min(newDt , defaultDt), 1.5*previousDt );// at 
maximum, dt will be multiplied by 1.5 in one iterration, this is to 
prevent brutal switches from 0.000... to 1 in some computations "

So with a previous Dt calculated at the last iteration equal to 0, the 
new calculated value will never be applied...

So my question is (-> Bruno ?) : _did I miss the interest of this line, 
or should I modify it so that my calculations could run ??_

You need to set the GlobalStiffnessTimeStepper::defaultDt to something
else than 0. It is max value for dt as well: therefore you get always zero.

My defaultDt was equal to 0.001... And even if it is indeed written in 
the .hpp that defaultDt is also max value, I don't see anywhere in the 
source I have why it would be the case.

Message-ID: <480470AD.1000008@hmg.inpg.fr>

Bad news : I could use a security factor of 1 on critical dt (as 
mentionned before) only because a bug was introduced in the computation 
of shear forces...
After fix, we need a securtity factor of 0.25 again. :(

Subject: [Yade-users] "Arbitrary parameter" in
	CohesiveFrictionalRelationships (or SimpleElasticRelationships)
Message-ID: <4804D06D.5050903@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello. Trying to use the local moment rotation law by using 
"CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw", I give a look to class 
"CohesiveFrictionalRelationships", and I have two questions about line 
88 to 94 (in version 1318).
- first of all are Da and Db the radii of the spheres in contact ? I 
tracked this Da an Db in the sources and it seems to me that it is the 
case, but because of their names I wanted to be sure that they are not 
diameters...
- then it is written that the "2.0" that appears in the calculations of 
the various rigidities are "arbitrary parameters". Why introducing 
"arbitrary parameters" ?

I ask this question because I want to use the results (the values of 
parameters calibrated) of the paper mentionned in the class ("Plassiard 
& al") and the comparison would be immediate without this 2.0 
coefficient (even if I should recognize that with it, it is not so much 
more complicated...)

Yes.

Two different answers :

For lines 88/89 : I am the author of the "2.0" factor. I can tell it is 
not arbitrary, it is because I define kn as E*diameter (why not 
E*radius? well... this is arbitrary ;)).

For line 94 : This equation is from Jean-Patrick Plassiard and was 
implemented by Janek. I really don't know if it is arbitrary or not (and 
perhaps the comment refers unadequatly to "arbitrary" factors of lines 
88/89 because Janek asked me "why two?", and I answered "arbitrary" 
without thinking twice).

Anyway, elastic behaviour at contacts is somewhat "arbitrary" isn't it? 
So having arbitrary parameters is not a problem in itself, you just need 
to know how things are defined.

It is strange that the factor is not in the paper too as the equations 
are supposed to be the same. Perhaps you are interpretating some values 
the wrong way. Remember that the stiffness of a contact is half of the 
stiffness of one body?

For the different particle size: have a look at TriaxialTest, it generates spheres at random of diameter .5 and 1.5 IIRC.

Thank you for these explanations. I think I see clear now for normal and 
tangential stiffnesses but I see always differences for rolling 
stiffness. In the mentionned paper the rolling stiffness kr (the one of 
"moment" = kr * "angle"), is defined as :
kr = a dimensionless parameter Br which multiplies ks * 
(mean(radii))^2,         (where ks is so the tangential stiffness of Fs 
= ks * Delta(us))

So I see two differences with what is in CohesiveFrictionalRelationships :


- first of all that's not (mean(radii))^2 that appears in Yade but 
product(radii)

- secondly, even in the case of a contact between two bodies with same 
radii (where this last remark vanishes), no parameter (which could be 
the "Br") appears in Yade, except this 2.0 (whereas for example in the 
paper the calibrated value of Br was 0.12)

To finish, but that's maybe less important, in this 
CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw the moment seems to not be limited by a 
plastic threshold. Is there an existing class where it is the case ?

Message-ID: <20080417085829.mo4dxfrw8wg80ckw@cubmail.cc.columbia.edu>

Good morning everyone,
I'm Benjamin Fragneaud and I recently decided to use this amazing  
program which is yade. I have really few knowledge in programation but  
I'm extremly motivated to learn more. First, I install Linux on my  
computer for the first time in order to use Yade. So, to make a long  
story short:
- I finally could install Kubuntu
- Yade is install and working
now I'd like to modify and/or create new classes (engine etc...)

To start with a very simple example I prefered to copy paste (with a  
different name) one of the preprocessor and step by step analyze it in  
order to understand how this program works. I should mention that I  
also read the documentation, the second small one for newby done by J.  
Duriez, as well as the wiki.

So, I have two new files called Triaxialtest2.cpp and  
Triaxialtest2.hpp. After that I run scons, it detects a new plugins,  
it compiles. Finally, I try to load it from the prepocesor window  
(qtGUI) and it doesn't appear in the list of preprocesors available,  
why ?
I know, and I'm sure that it must be something very simple. Please,  
forgive my basic knowledge (remind that I'm new to that stuff).

Thanks you for you help,
Sincerely,
Benjamin

Did you modify the "Sconscript" file (in pkg/dem) that "controls the 
compilation" ?
If not you should set a new paragraph for your new Preprocessor (in your 
case you only have to copy the one of TriaxialTest and write 
TriaxialTest2 instead of TriaxialTest)

exactly, you need to edit pkg/dem/SConscript file and copy/paste the section
related to TriaxalText.cpp, and modify it to use TriaxialTest2.cpp

If you, please, add this info to wiki - you will help everyone else
in the future! Just click "edit" on a wiki page, you don't need to
register.

As soon As I have it working, I'll be pleased to add this information to the
wiki. Is there anything more than repeat the command "scons" in order to
actualize yade and its plugins?

exactly, you need to edit pkg/dem/SConscript file and copy/paste the section
related to TriaxalText.cpp, and modify it to use TriaxialTest2.cpp

If you, please, add this info to wiki - you will help everyone else
in the future! Just click "edit" on a wiki page, you don't need to
register.

Rana,

please pay attention how your email is formatted.... All lines were
concatenated together, and I had problems with reading your
questions. Please have a look at http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

what is the question exactly? The formula used is already written here...

you can put there any number you want.

see answer by Jerome.

> 2.sigma_iso = 50000..is it isotropic pressure?  I have checked the following reference.

yes but it depends which walls are activated, see for example in the xml file "wall_bottom_activated", etc..., and you can set any value that you want.

That's a good place.

SDEC manual does not apply to YADE. Of course YADE is based on SDEC
and uses the same formulas, but developing with YADE is completely
different than with SDEC.

If you added TriaxialTest2.cpp to SConscript, then it should work. To
be completely sure you can:

1. look into place where yade is installed, see in directory 
     lib/yade-*/pkg-dem/
   if it contains file libTriaxialTest2.so, a file libTriaxialTest.so *will* be there.

2. you can try to recompile everything, run 'scons -c' (or scons
clean if you are using latest SVN version), delete the directory
"../build-*", and compile again by running 'scons'

3. which version of yade are you using?

4. Also check in SConscript if you correctly added "2" for TriaxialTest2.cpp

Oh, and also remember to change your class name! If you have TWO
classes with the same name "TriaxialTest" it will not work. And also
you must modify the include guard #ifndef ..... in the
TriaxialTest2.hpp file.

That's a basic stuff. You could add it to wiki too, as this is a
quite common mistake.

Perfect !!! it works, I'm all set. As soon as I have some results, and 
some commentaries, I'll let you know about what's going-on. That's 
really an excellent and exiting project !!! I'm very please to be  (a 
small) part of that.
I'll try to actualize the wiki at night.
Thanks again

Hi Benjamin,

Did you look at the terminal window and see there is any error? That problem can happen if there are some errors in linking library or even careless error.

Did you modify the "Sconscript" file (in pkg/dem) that "controls the

If not you should set a new paragraph for your new Preprocessor (in your

0.3 is not computed, its just 0.3. If you prefer 0.5 you can modify 
this. What should be done in fact is to add a registered parameter that 
could be changed by users.


>  1.what is the significance of damping force and damping moment?of course in dem they have significance effect. But from which part of YADE, I can make look to know about these..like to chose the value..default given 0.2. 
Just to be sure : you know that you can use ctags from inside kdevelop 
to find where a variable is defined? Look into classes with damping in 
their names, damping is used in them.

>  2.sigma_iso = 50000..is it isotropic pressure?
Yes, it is the pressure that TriaxialStressController will try to 
maintain on each "activated" boundary.
So... it is not always isotropic as less than 6 boudaries may be 
activated at the same time.

For questions like this, unfortunately not.
You can ask here when you have precise questions on the meaning of some 
parameters.
However, if you feel like commenting the code here and there in the 
meantime, you can always send me commented files and I'll commit them on 
the SVN server.

Thank you Jerome for working with moment law! You are the first
person to try it after I implemented it with all testing.

This law is "different" from Jean-Patrick law in only one way: it is
implemented using quaternions. The most important formula is only one
line and looks like:

delta=A'*A^(-1)*B*B'^(-1)

where A,B are initial body orientation, and A',B' are current
orientation, expressed using quaternions. Whole calculation is just a
few lines. I've seen JP's law and it wasn't just a few lines... it
was a too long for me to understand it. So I had to develop this one
from scratch. I tested it very much, and it works for all cases that
I tried.

I should put a wiki page about this "theoretical background", sometime.

Basically this law should work in a similar way as JP's law, with one
exception: This formula behaves elastically for both bending AND
twisting. While JP did not have twisting. It means that to fully
reproduce JP results you would need to set twisting stiffness to zero.

But currently only one stiffness is used "kr". It is used for both
bending and twisting. We need to introduce another stiffness
parameter here.

yes, I used product of two radii instead of square of minimum radii.
If you feel uncomfortable with that you can change it and commit it.
Just comment the original line.

I had another paper from JP, and there he was checking different
values, between 0.01 and 4.0. I picked just one of them (happened to
be 2.0). But it would be very useful from your side, if you
implemented this as an additional parameter, configured from
FileGenerator.

yep. There is no plastic threshold, as I was too lazy to implement
it. The moment low is currently fully elastic. You are welcome to add
plastic threshold parameter and commit it :) But provide also a way
for not using it (for example a bool flag). So that later if someone
wants elastic-only behaviour - he can get it.

best regards

Subject: [Yade-users] Capillary law files
Message-ID: <136794.1779.qm@web15809.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>

Hi,everyone.
In the  TriaxialTestWater.cpp there is a comment "this
test will not work without data file for capillary
law",and in CapillaryCohesiveLaw.cpp it's said the
import files in the "../data",whose filename like
M(r=...) .However i can't find the files in yade
dirctionary.
Is there any papers about the capillary law in yade? I
don't know the parameters V,F,delta1 and delta2 stand
for what and how the capillary were computed in
CapillaryCohesiveLaw.cpp.
Thank you!
                                            zhanglin

Hi Zhanglin

In fact, capillary files (M(r=...)) are not yet implemented in Yade directory because  I am actually working on capillary effects modelling for my PhD thesis (currently, I can send them to whom is interested). 

The capillary law is based on a resolution scheme of the Laplace Young equation which defines capillary water liquid bridges between 2 spherical bodies. You can see paragraph 2 from "Influence of liquid bridges on the mechanical behaviour of polydisperse granular materials" by Fabien Souli?, International Journal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics 2006, (30): 213-228 for the resolution scheme. Instead of F. Souli?, I did not tried to find an analytical form for the capillary force: the force F, volume of water V and half-filling angles delta1 and delta2 for each grain-pair of radii R1 and R2 are computed from the capillary files, depending on the defined capillary pressure (the unique additionnal input parameter in the interface) and the R2/R1 ratio (denoted r in M(r=...)).

Few more description of my work can be found in the Annual report of the Discrete Element Group from our lab : http://geo.hmg.inpg.fr/frederic/Discrete_Element_Group_FVD.html

I hope this will be enough to clarify the CapillaryCohesiveLaw computations. If not, I will be pleased to teach you more. 

Regards

    Luc

Perhaps an infinite (or very high value) of the threshold can do the 
same as a flag for turning plasticity off?
Anyway, J?r?me, keep in mind that breaking a contact implies other 
things, as you can see in cohesive frictional law (e.g. breaking a 
contact in bending should disable tensile strength as well, also setting 
isReal=false must be done in some circumstances). Perhaps we will have 
to talk about this a bit because this contact law is not so easy to read...

Hi Zanglin

Currently, all this code on capillary forces is still developped by Luc
Scholtes in his PhD thesis. It is still in a research stage and is not
really supposed to be used by somebody else. The import files in ../data
contain the relations between volume, force, etc., but they are not part
of Yade for the moment (capillaryLaw will still work iirc, but capillary
forces will be 0).
I think Luc can send you few papers on this, and more papers will be
published soon.

I was actually thinking about rather using -1 instead of +infinity.

Message-ID: <48205EFD.4030802@columbia.edu>

Hi everyone,
I'm Benjamin, I recently installed Yade and it started to work 
perfectly... But for any reasons I had to uninstall it.
I tried multiple times to reinstall it but the preprocessor seems to be 
broken, and here is my problem. let me give you the process I used to 
install it:

- Unpack the yade-0.11.1.tar.gz package
- then I run in a terminal window scons, with the following options

PREFIX = '/home/benjamin/Desktop/yade/yade-0.11.1/yade_install'
optimize = True
exclude = 'none'
features = 'log4cxx,python'
QTDIR = ['/usr/share/qt3', '/usr/lib/qt', '/usr/qt/3', '/usr/lib/qt-3.3']
CXXFLAGS = ['$CCFLAGS']

the program build... and then when I open Yade and click on preprocessor 
the program shut down.

Do you have any ideas of what is happening?

Thanks for your help,
Benjamin

Hi,
  Can you check YADE?Is there bin,include,lib,and data?I have faced same problem and found "bin" missing though "building target"...
   
  In this case I have reinstall the system.
   
  Can you inform which platform you are using?Ubuntu older like 7.04?

I have no clue on your problem unfortunately, but I recommend to 
download the version from SVN (see details on the web page) because this 
0.11.1 version is now a bit old.

More precisely? You can improve Yade by telling us what kind of problems
do you have and I will fix wiki so that other people don't face the same
problem again.

For the original problem: make sure you have the "gdb" (debugger)
package installed and that you build with debug=1 (implicit value). If
you run yade from terminal, it will output backtrace when it crashes,
which helps to find out what happened very quickly.

Regards, Vaclav

Hi Vaclav,
I am running with the debug option on. It says that it doesn't detect 
foreach.hpp in the boost library:

/"In file included from core/BodyContainer.hpp:16,
                 from core/BodyContainer.cpp:11:

error: boost/foreach.hpp: No such file or directory
" etc...
/
but I found it in boost/test/util. So to see that it was just a problem 
of library location, I copy paste it in boost/ and then it says. This 
first problem diseapear, but now it says:

/"usr/include/features.h:150:1: warning: this is the location of the

I am sure it says something _berfore_ this line, that a macro was
redefined. Knowing which macro it is is important. What distro are you
on? foreach.hpp was integrated into boost for the 1.34 version IIRC, you
can either upgrade or copy foreach.hpp from 1.34, which is what I would
advise. Janek posted that file to the mailing list recently
(http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.physics.yade.devel/367).

(Your version from test/util/foreach.hpp seems to not define
BOOST_FOREACH, since otherwise it would not get to the compiler but
would be replaced by the preprocessor.)

Hi, all:
 
I am recently having such kind of problem, I have two costomized engines, one is  called "ConvergenceEstimator", which is used to evaluate some maximumUnBalanceForce over the contactForce ratio (this will return a CCValue to evaluate whether the whole particle system is close to equilibrium), then I have another engine "DampingAdjustment" designed to change the initial simulation parameter, in my case, the damping coefficient, for example, from 0.3 to 0.4.
 
I have one piece of code in the preprocessor (similar to SDECSpheresPlane) which looks like this:
 
///--------------------
...
rootBody->engines.push_back(ConvergenceEstimator);
rootBody->engines.push_back(DampingAdjustment);
///--------------------
 
This means my DampingAdjustment Engine needs the return values of the previous engine, I need to have something in DampingAdjustment like(I think should be in DampingAdjustment::applyCondition(Body* body)):
 
if (convergenceEstimator->getCCVaue() <=eps)
     dampingCoefficient = 0.3;
else
     dampingCoefficient =0.5;
 
I think this is purely a programming problem, how to access the ConvergenceEstimator which is the other engine?
 
I hope I have made my problem clear. Thank you very much!

Hello. It is indeed possible. The simplest is maybe to declare and
define in your Engine DampingAdjustement a pointer towards an Engine
ConvergenceEstimator, with something like that :
/shared_ptr<ConvergenceEstimator> convergenceEstimator =
shared_ptr<ConvergenceEstimator> (new ConvergenceEstimator);/

(don't forget to include the good files and to modify the Sconscript !)
and then you can use your method of this Engine in your
DampingAdjustement, with the line you wrote :
/
convergenceEstimator->getCCValue()
/
But you will surely have to modify a bit your definition of "getCCValue"
function of the ConvergenceEstimator : she will need to have as a
parameter the Metabody of the simulation : so you would have to declare
this function with something like
/Real ConvergenceEstimator::getCCValue//(Body * body)
/
and then call it from the DampingAdjustement in fact with :
/convergenceEstimator->getCCValue(body)
/(this body here is the one which was passed to the applyCondition of
DampingAdjustement)/
/

If you have it in your version of Yade you could give a look to
"TriaxialStateRecorder" (in pkg/dem/Engine/DeusExMachina/) : this Engine
uses like you (and records) the value of the UnbalancedForce computed by
the other Engine "TriaxialStressController". In this case it is a bit
more complicated than what I said to you, because the
TriaxialStateRecorder cares to find in the list of Engines present in
the simulation the one which is a TriaxialStressController instead of
creating a new one, like I adviced.

Hoping having been enough clear...

Hi, I think this is somthing like:
 
YourEngineName::applyCondition(Body* body)
{
  Omega::instance().stopSimulationLoop();
}
You can look at the previous posts. Or the class definition of Omaga, I forgot where:-)

stopSimulationLoop() may be delayed (is called from different thread) so
it will not stop with the precision of 1 iteration. If you need that,
you can set
Omega::instance().stopAtIteration=Omega::instance().getCurrentIteration()+1.

If you are sure that you will always have at most one
ConvergenceEstimator engine running, I would use static variable for that:

in the header:

class ConvergenceEstimator{
/* ... */
public:
static Real someValue;
}

create memory space for that in the .cpp file:

Real ConvergenceEstimator::someValue;

Then you can retrieve the value in DampingAdjustment by saying
ConvergenceEstimator::someValue.

One more solution can be to scan the list of engines form inside one engine.
You have an exemple in TriaxialStateRecorder, which record variables of 
TriaxialCompressionEngine.


This first part will be executed only once :

TriaxialStateRecorder.cpp, Line 69 :
 
if ( !triaxialCompressionEngine )                
//(triaxialCompressionEngine is a pointer to an object of this type)
    {
        vector<shared_ptr<Engine> >::iterator itFirst = 
ncb->engines.begin();
        vector<shared_ptr<Engine> >::iterator itLast = ncb->engines.end();
        for ( ;itFirst!=itLast; ++itFirst )
        {
            if ( ( *itFirst )->getClassName() == 
"TriaxialCompressionEngine" ) //|| (*itFirst)->getBaseClassName() == 
"TriaxialCompressionEngine")
            {
                LOG_DEBUG ( "stress controller engine found" );
                triaxialCompressionEngine =  
YADE_PTR_CAST<TriaxialCompressionEngine> ( *itFirst );
                //triaxialCompressionEngine = 
shared_ptr<TriaxialCompressionEngine> 
(static_cast<TriaxialCompressionEngine*> ( (*itFirst).get()));
            }
        }
    }


Then the initialized pointer is used to get data from the engine, like 
at line 91 :

Real V = ( triaxialCompressionEngine->height ) * ( 
triaxialCompressionEngine->width ) * ( triaxialCompressionEngine->depth );

Your "DampingAdjustment" could just do the same and scan engines to find 
a "ConvergenceEstimator".

The solution proposed by Va?lav should work too.

The only thing to watch out is _not_ to register the engine pointer as
attribute. The deserializer would create new instance instead of pointer
to the already existing instance.

("only once": more precisely, after every deserialization - like if you
interrupt, save and load again the simulation.)

Message-ID: <BAY128-W15A28787786070D519B36EB1CF0@phx.gbl>


I have slackware(version 12.0) properly installed on my  Vmware. I want to use yade in it. 
I've installed boost 1.35.0(I built it from source) and there are /usr/local/include/boost directory in which there are a lot of .hpp files and /usr/local/lib directory in which there are a lot of .so files.
There are already qt3 bundled with Slackware, So I've just installed qt3-mt components. I unpacked the deb package libqt3-mt-dev.deb and used installpkg to install it.
I've successfully installed freeglut3.
make and g++ are bundled with Slackware distribution.
scons build system is installed successfully and it looks working quite well.

I run the command in ~/yade-0.11.1:
scons PREFIX=/home/username/YADE optimize=1
and
  then failed. 
the error output is the attachment of this mail.

I hope you can help me!
Thank you!

A potential problem for you:
 
When you are using the VMWare, I think it is difficult to install the 3D video driver and therefore your 3D graphics simulation will be very slow based on software acceleration.

The compiler is not able to find boost.
/home/xsx/build-0.11.1/config.log has all details, you can attach that
file if you've no luck with the followin. Basically, the problem can be
that either the proprocessor doesn't find boost headers and/or the
linker doesn't find the libs. Since you have those in non-standard
location (/usr/local/lib), you have to use those flags to scons:

scons CPPPATH=/usr/local/include LIBPATH=/usr/local/lib

Remember you have to do this only once, flags will be remembered.

You may stumble upon the libQGLViewer library not being found. If you
do, use recent svn instead of 0.11.1 - I've integrated qglviewer into
our own codebase and it is not necessary to have it installed.

As Feng said, I would assume the 3d view will be quite slow, since all
rendering will be done in software - don't expect miracles here.

Hi, all:
 
I have an assembly of particles which needs to consolidate first, then I need to apply a surcharge on top of them. I thought of two ways:
(1) apply a box on top of the assembly. But my question is how to add a box (dynamic = true) after a certain steps, for example, first iterate 5k steps then activate the top box? 
(2) Apply a force on top of the load, adding another "Engine", count the iteration number "Niter", after "Niter", add the load on top of the particle assembly.
 
Hope I have made my problem clear. I think the 1st way is better, is there any sample code that I can look into? Or just provide some ideas.
 
Thank you very much!

I have updated a conference paper using YADE and OpenFOAM to the publication page:
 
Chen, F., Drumm, E.C., Guiochon, G., and Suzuki, K. (2008) ?Discrete Element Simulation of 1D Upward Seepage Flow with Particle-Fluid Interaction Using Coupled Open Source Software? Paper # 730098903 Proceedings of The 12th International Conference of the International Association for Computer Methods and Advances in Geomechanics (IACMAG), Goa, India , 1-6 October, 2008.

Hope that will helpful.
 
Another question is about citing YADE, my advisor thought it some "flaky" to cite an unpublished paper, therefore I added the YADE website to the reference, are the two publications on the publication page (the two we supposed to cite in our publication) accepted already?
 
Thanks!

so here's good news - both articles were just accepted few days ago.
The first one has its title changed, I'm updating the site right now.
I'll upload pre-submit version of pdfs too.

Message-ID: <482D3B7C.6020907@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>


Hello,
 
   This is just to say with the r1351, the parameters within the 
scons.config are not taken into account during the building.

scons:***[/usr/local/include/yade-svn1351] 
/usr/local/include/yade-svn1351: Permission denied

Have you the same problem?

Hi,

that is expected and it changed in 1344, see changelog.

Short answer: You can copy your old scons.config to
scons.profile-default and you will get old behavior.

Long answer: scons.config is replaced by scons.profile-*, where * is any
name you select with "scons profile=..." ('default' if you say just
profile= ) and allows you to switch between complete independent sets of
build options.

There are 2 profiles predefined: default (or empty name), which is
debugging build. And 'opt', which is optimizing build (by default). You
can create any new profile by using profile=something and then
specifying other params. The current profile that will be used is stored
in scons.current-profile.

The point was to quickly switch different build options without writing
them all down. So now I can say "scons profile=default" and have the
debugged build and "scons profile=opt" and get the optimized build.
Otherwise, I would have to do thusly:

 scons optimize=false debug=true variant=''

and then

 scons optimize=true debug=false variant=-opt

Hope it is clear.

In any case you will have to write engine that will check iteration
number and if the condition is met, do some action. in (1), it would
create the box body, add ForceEngine to engines and subscribe the box to
the engine. (2) seems quite complicated, since loading the particle
assembly without the wall, you have to say which elements are on the
boundary, if I understand what you mean in (2).

---

In Python you could do it like this:

[create simulation]
o=Omega()
o.run(5000) # run 5000 iterations
boxId=o.bodies.append(yade.utils.box([cx,cy,cz],[extx,exty,extz],density=...,...))
# create box, add it to bodies, save body id
# put ForceEngine after the 5th engine (for example)
o.engines=o.engines[:5]+DeusExMachina("ForceEngine",{'force'=[0,0,-100],'subscribedBodies':[boxId]})+o.engines[5:]
o.run() #continue simulation

But currently there is no 3d view in PythonUI, which is a considerable
problem :-|. You could overcome this by calling yade.utils.runInQtGui()
one the engine is added (instead of o.run()). That saves simulation to
file and loads it in the GUI.

hi, Dear All,

I have downloaded the wildmagic311 , and maked it using
make CONFIG=ReleaseMemory -f makefile.lnx
but I do not know whether it is installed into my system because I just read
the makefile.lnx that there is only build part, not installed, how can I
install it?

Thanks.

Try "make install"; perhaps there is no install target and you have to
copy everything to /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib (in that case,
make sure you specify LIBPATH=/usr/local/lib and
CPPPATH=/usr/local/include to scons)

---

Do you really need full wm3? Since Yade 0.11.0, reduced version of
wildmagic is in our source tree.

If you are on debian, see
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_details#Installing_the_wildmagic_3_library_on_debian
to get prepackaged version.

Just read debian/rules in the debian package:

	# installation - manualy, because upstream's make does not provide
	# install target
	#mkdir $(CURDIR)/debian/wildmagic-dev/usr/lib $(CURDIR)/debian/wildmagic-dev/usr/include
	cp $(SOURCE_DIR)/GeometricTools/WildMagic3/Library/Release/lib*.a $(CURDIR)/debian/wildmagic-dev/usr/lib
	cp -r $(SOURCE_DIR)/GeometricTools/WildMagic3/Include $(CURDIR)/debian/wildmagic-dev/usr/include/wm3

You have to install files manually.

Hi, Vaclav,
 
Sorry, I didn't know that, I thought the threads are just identified by their title:-|.
Thanks for your reply, since I need to do a lot of "dynamic" things like add or remove an object during the simulation, always writing a new engine and adjust those parameters might be very inefficient.
do you know how can I start the python interface for YADE, is there any sample code already in the package? It looks a very efficient way of doing "dynamic" operations.

One more solution can be to scan the list of engines form inside one engine.
You have an exemple in TriaxialStateRecorder, which record variables of 
TriaxialCompressionEngine.


This first part will be executed only once :

TriaxialStateRecorder.cpp, Line 69 :
 
if ( !triaxialCompressionEngine )                
//(triaxialCompressionEngine is a pointer to an object of this type)
    {
        vector<shared_ptr<Engine> >::iterator itFirst = 
ncb->engines.begin();
        vector<shared_ptr<Engine> >::iterator itLast = ncb->engines.end();
        for ( ;itFirst!=itLast; ++itFirst )
        {
            if ( ( *itFirst )->getClassName() == 
"TriaxialCompressionEngine" ) //|| (*itFirst)->getBaseClassName() == 
"TriaxialCompressionEngine")
            {
                LOG_DEBUG ( "stress controller engine found" );
                triaxialCompressionEngine =  
YADE_PTR_CAST<TriaxialCompressionEngine> ( *itFirst );
                //triaxialCompressionEngine = 
shared_ptr<TriaxialCompressionEngine> 
(static_cast<TriaxialCompressionEngine*> ( (*itFirst).get()));
            }
        }
    }


Then the initialized pointer is used to get data from the engine, like 
at line 91 :

Real V = ( triaxialCompressionEngine->height ) * ( 
triaxialCompressionEngine->width ) * ( triaxialCompressionEngine->depth );

Your "DampingAdjustment" could just do the same and scan engines to find 
a "ConvergenceEstimator".

The solution proposed by Va?lav should work too.

static_cast is fine, as long as the supposition that if a class gives
"ConvergenceEstimater" as its name, it is really an instance of
ConvergenEstimater.

I would rewrite th return part like this:

    if(convergenceEstimater) return convergenceEstimater->getCCValue();
    else throw runtime_error("No ConvergenceEstimater engine was found!");

Since if you happen to forget to add that engine, the loop will end
without having found anything a you will get NULL pointer access in
return. It is true that it will result in the same: crash. But the
exception can hint for the user about what went wrong.

There is some documentation on the wiki, notably
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/PythonPrimer and
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/SimpleSceneTutorial (which has the same
preprocessor written in both python and c++).

I hope to find out a solution for qglviewer with python, which would
make the PythonUI (alomost) fully featured; without the 3d rendering, it
may be difficult to say whether things are going right or not.

Apt-get and aptitude are almost the same thing (aptitude tends to have
better conflict resolution in complex situations and has quite powerful
UI (apt-get has none), but neither is your issue now).

Installation will be the same as for hardy. Depending on whether you use
SVN (recommended) or the 0.11.* version of yade: in the latter case you
will have to use libqglviewer package which is in lenny; the binary is
broken in hardy and has to be recompiled from source package, maybe it
works out-of-box on lenny. If you use SVN, you don't need that.

Follow
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_of_yade_on_debian_or_kubuntu and
let us know if you encounter some problems.

Subject: [Yade-users] Velocities of non dynamic bodies, for contact laws ?
Message-ID: <4831A896.1000500@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello everbody. I have a question about the meaning of velocities of 
"non dynamic" bodies. Is it computed even if it is not set by an Engine, 
and if yes how ?
The idea of this question is the case of non dynamic bodies which are 
controlled by deus ex machina Engines, but only through their positions, 
example : the walls of the triaxialTest who are controlled by the 
TriaxialCompressionEngine.
Considering moreover the fact that in the contact laws that's the 
velocities of the bodies which are used to compute the relative 
displacements, how does this (well) work ?
Thanks

Jerome

Guys, since the latest revision (1357), you can use python console with
the qt interface (you start normally, but yade must be compiled with
python support) at the same time. I hope it will be useful as it is
useful already for me. (Planned: saving session (commands) to file from
ipython, with replay at startup. History saving (like in shell) accross
sessions doesn't work for reasons that I don't know.)

Thanks a lot, Vaclav, although I am still using a very outdated version of YADE (0.10.0, I already have a lot of codes under 0.10.0, but since version 0.11.1, so many class names needs to change:-{), I will try to move to SVN soon.

No, as seems to me. The positions, velocities and so of "non dynamic" 
bodies is set only by an kinematic Engine.

With the linear velocities here no problem. But with the rotation of kinematic 
body relative velocity at the contact point is defined correctly only if this 
body rotated around its se3.position and the contact point lies on the line 
linking bodies centers (at lest for ElasticContactLaw with 
SphericalContactGeometry).

I think that the new attribute zeroPoint should be added to the class 
RigidBody. This zeroPoint will determine the center of rotation kinematic 
(non-isDynamic) body.

Why really no problem ? I wonder in fact about the case of an 
interaction between a non dynamic body (whose velocity was never 
affected by an Engine) and a dynamic one, example : a sphere and a wall 
in the TriaxialTest. If the velocity of the wall is indeed zero (as it 
was defined so in the createBox of the PreProcessor of TriaxialTest, and 
never changed after), _whereas its position changes_, the computations 
of relative displacements between this wall and the sphere will be 
wrong, not ?
Thanks

Wall's velocity is need if
1. there is the shear contact => the velocity is need for incremental shear displacement (=>the shear force, friction)
2. there is the viscous dissipation => the  velocity is need for dumping force.
For normal elastic contact without viscous the velocity isn't need (the normal displacement is nonincremental but instantaneous)
In you example, as seems, the wall's shear movement will be not influence on the sphere... 
Is that a bug or a feature is dependent on TriaxialTest purposes. :)

Ok, thank you for this summary, now I think I see quite clear.
    In fact unfortunately for me I make simulations of direct shear box 
(with DirectShearCis preprocessor), I took the example of TriaxialTest 
only because I think a lot of Yade-users know it. So I think I will now 
pay attention to the velocities I set...
Thanks

Hi,

I'm new to the list, and I'm not sure this is a problem with Yade per
se, but perhaps someone has had the same issue and can help... when we
use yade locally, the software works perfect, but if we try to use it
over the network (with either a VNC client on Windows or by simple X
redirection on Linux) the visualization shows up as a grey box, and
it's hence unusable.

Other visualization software like Mathematica work fine, but perhaps
the rendering engines are different?

Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks,

Sergio.

Hi, I once remotely used Yade through VNCviewer (both on WinXP and fedora 4). As you described the grey box, I think it was just very very slow, after a "grey box", it will show a static picture (although I think the simulation is going on). I think the delay is due to remote connection, and VNCviewer might not be a good solution, it works well for typical GUI (I can use KDevelop, gdb or other to program) but might not work on OpenGL 3D rendering.

What's weird to me is that it used to work over our network. Perhaps
traffic increased to the point where it doesn't work anymore, but I
don't see how.

I was running an openGL app over LAN  and it workded resonably well.

Accelerated graphics has really two parts: DRI (direct rendering), where
the Xserver accesses video memory card directly and GL, which is the
rendering done on the card.

If you go over LAN with X11 (and GL is enabled), you don't have DRI, but
_do_ have accelerated rendering (it is still done on the graphics card).
OTOH, with VNC you don't have neither DRI nor accelerated rendering, I
think; that's why it's so slow.

Please post any messages from console, if there are any relevant to video.

You can try running glxgears (if that works) and post glxinfo output.

Subject: [Yade-users] Flags "isNew" and "isReal" of interactions / computing
	tan(phi)
Message-ID: <4835597D.5040509@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello everybody. I would have this time a question about the flags 
"isNew" and "isReal" of interactions.
Considering simulations where you want change the friction angle of your 
bodies (example : triaxial tests where you compact initially your sample 
with phi = 0 for example, and then after you want make your "real" 
simulations with phi = 30 degrees), the method setContactProperties 
allows to do this, but it seems to me that there is a problem : this 
method changes the values of friction angles of bodies and computes the 
value of tan(phi) of the interactions between the bodies whose friction 
angle changed, but _only if this interactions are real_.
    And the problem is that I found in my simulations interactions 
between two given bodies which were created at a given instant (when the 
friction angles were equal to 0) but became non real before the changes 
in phi were set (and so these interactions were not changed at this 
time), and then become again real, without passing through a "new" state 
(which would allow their friction Angle to be correctly computed by the 
"Relationships" of the contact law). So
- is it really possible for an interaction to follow these states : 
(isNew = 1) => (isReal = 1 and isNew = 0) => (isReal = 0 and isNew = 0) 
=> (isReal = 1 and isNew = 0) ? (and not isNew =1)
I think strongly that it is the case but if you say me that it is not 
I'm ready to listen to your explanations

- what would you advice to do to solve these problems : computing the 
values of properties of interactions always, even !isNew ??

Thanks

Jerome

The state :

(isReal = 0 and isNew = 0)

is possible in a transient situation at the end of one timestep.
But, at the beginning of the next step, the collider will do this 
(PersistentSAPCollider.cpp l.76) :

for(InteractionContainer::iterator I=transientInteractions->begin(); 
I!=I_end; ++I) {
        if ((*I)->isReal) (*I)->isNew=false; //
        else (*I)->isNew=true;

So, in principle (but I can always have missed something) the transition

(isReal = 0 and isNew = 0) 
=> (isReal = 1 and isNew = 0)

will not happen.

I did not define the velocity of boundaries in TriaxialEngine because I 
knew I would not rotate boundaries and I have no friction or viscous 
effect on boundaries. If you need tangential effects on boxes, all you 
need is to define the velocity at the time you define the new position 
(velocity = (newPosition-lastPosition)/timestep. As a consequence, there 
is no need to make a difference between dynamic and not-dynamic bodies 
in the contact laws.
I realize I should have answer before because Sega tried to fix that a 
different way and I'm not sure it really fixed anything.

I'm sort of new to the graphics rendering area , but glxgears worked
when called via network (through the command line in a Linux client;
it doesn't work when called via VNC). Command line reported between
485 and 205 FPS.

glxinfo output is below.

Ok, in this case. Unfortunately for me I used in fact the 
DistantPersistentSAPCollider wich is a bit different and with which the 
transition I speak about seems indeed to be possible... I never 
interested me enough about these Engines so I surely copied somewhere 
the lines to insert it in my simulations without understanding them. 
Unless being very very very lucky that's really not the way to deal with 
YADE...

Message-ID: <20080528082147.kibqm9n6x440ss8w@cubmail.cc.columbia.edu>

Hi everybody,
I'm trying to create an Engine that aplly Electrostatic force to a sphere.
I?d like to allow displacement of bodies depending on the charge and  
the electrical potential.
Perhaps I should precise that I?m quiet new to Yade and C++ programmation.

To do so, I decided to inspire myself with an already written  
preprocesor: "funnel", which has been modified in order to generate a  
random cloud of spheres in a closed box.
At this step every thing is working as I want to.

* Creation of a new stand alone Engine:
As well as I did before, I used an already written engine and modified  
it. But here is the problem.
- I copy paste the GravityEngine.
- rename it, rename the functions within and shrd_ptr,
- I also rename the .hpp file
- add it in the corresponding scons file
It compiled well (no error) and was added to the libnewengine.so.

In esance it should do exactly the same thing than the GravityEngine  
but with a different name.

Nevertheless, when I try to use it within my new preprocessor, it  
doesn?t appear anymore in the preprocessor generator list (yade  
graphique interface).

Moreover, If I just declare it in the list of classes used withtout  
using it (like declaring something that you don?t use), the  
preprocessor also don?t appear in the preprocessor list...
Is anybody has any idea about what is wrong.
Thanks for your help,
Best,
Ben

I think that's typically because you didn't modify the ? concerning the 
preprocessor file in the "Sconscript". You have also to modify it by 
adding a line with the name of your new engine.

Agreed. First, check that your files are really compiled (you should see 
a newEngine.so in install dirs). If they are not, it is probably due to 
a missing declaration in SConscript files (those files define what needs 
to be compiled and the dependencies between classes).
Just copy/paste/rename the GravityEngine section in dem/Sconscript (or 
common/SConscript, not sure).

IIRC, the preprocessor will not appear in the interface if one of the 
plugin (the library corresponding to your new class) is not found. I 
think this will happen as soon as you declare the missing class in your 
code, it doesn't matter if you use it or not.
Don't you get any compilation errors? warnings when you start Yade?

If I understand correctly, you will need to play with distant 
interactions (without contact), which means you could be interested by 
the current discussion on this topic here : 
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Sanitizing_Contact_Logic.

Hi,
thank you for your advises. It seems to be working. I just forgot to 
declare it in the library dependency within the sconscript file 
corrresponding to my newpreprocessor file. I'll have a look at the new 
topic right now.
Thanks again,
Ben

Hi,
    I've just installed yade. I want to build my own model. Is there any instructions to write a preprocessor generator in C++ or python?I'm blocked to wikia(government bans wikia).I want some papers on it. Another question, I want to implement coupling simulation with FEM and DEM(part of the model area is dealt with FEM while the other area is simultaneously dealt with DEM). Could yade be capable for such task?
    Thank you!

hi, 

I think YADE already provided FEM-DEM coupling example, you can try using proxy to get on wikia, I was in Shanghai on January, I remembered YADE was ok at that time, it is now blocked? Is it possible to provide some mirrors such as in sourceforge.net?:-)

I will be coupling DEM in Yade with oofem (oofem.org) next year (from
september or so) - maybe. But I've never really tried fem that is in
yade, from the code itself it seemed to be pretty rudimentary and only
proof-of-concept.

I've set up apache proxy at http://beta.arcig.cz/wiki/ (note the
trailing /)where you can access the wiki. (Note to others: please don't
use this, the server does not have thick cable to the internet!!). I
wasn't able to set up internal HTML rewriting, so links outside
yade.wikia.com will not be proxied.

For publications, they are on http://images.wikia.com and you will have
to REWRITE THE LINK BY HAND e.g.
http://images.wikia.com/yade/images//3/30/CMAME_YADE_2008.pdf to
http://beta.arcig.cz/images.wikia.com/yade/images//3/30/CMAME_YADE_2008.pdf
(simply prepend beta.arcig.cz).

Let me know if it works.

Subject: [Yade-users] Problem of installition on kubuntu8.04
Message-ID: <91031.41986.qm@web15804.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>

    Fewer months ago I installed yade on ubuntu 7.10
successfully. However when I turn to kubuntu8.04 ,I
recieved the following error message during
installition:

scons: Reading SConscript files ...
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:
'0d20071203':
  File
"/home/beautykiller/Desktop/yade-0.11.1/SConstruct",
line 28:
   
sconsVersion=sum([int(SCons.__version__.split('.')[ord[0]])*ord[1]
for ord in
[(0,10000),(1,100),(2,1)][:len(SCons.__version__.split('.'))]
])


    I install kubuntu7.10 and update to 8.04.Does it
matter with the error?
    I've searched the mail-list for the error and
found the someone asked long before . I follow the
answer but the error stand still. 
    I know little about python and have no idea what
the statement(line 28) stand for. Is the scons version
wrong? or the file sconstruct too old for newer
kubuntu?
    I tried to replace line 28 with
"sconsVersion=20071203" , I recieved another error
message. I can't remember what it exactly is. It
sounds there is a error in line 100(or 101) :the
function needs 5 parameters but recieve 6 actully.
Thanks for any help!

What yade version do you use, 0.11.1? The sconsVersion should be
numeric-comparable version of scons, 9700 for 0.97.00 and so on. So you
can try setting it to 9699 or 9700 and one of them will work (probably
9699): 0.97 introduced different argument number for the
FormatOptionHelpText function and there is conditional handling that.

Hope it works.

You may prefer to use SVN version (trunk).

Subject: [Yade-users] Libraries problems with a Cluster
Message-ID: <484558AF.3020504@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello,

In my laboratory, a cluster with a few nodes has been installed.  So 
normally we could use YADE with, except that we have some problems. Two 
versions are installed, the base version reachable by everybody and my 
version locally installed in my part of the cluster.

On the one hand, when we use the base version, after writing "yade", the 
message is the following:

/Constructing ClassFactory  (if multiple times - check '-rdynamic' flag!).

On the other hand, when I use my version, which works marvelously in my 
computer, the message is the following:

/./yade-0.11.0: error while loading shared libraries: 
libpython2.4.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or 
directory
/

I didn't install all the libraries, but according to our computer 
engineer R?mi (I think you can add somethings R?mi...), everything has 
been installed. So do you know where could it come from ?

Check that you have the plugin libXMLFormatManager.so somewhere. Did you
compile yade on the same machine? If not, make sure plugins are
installed in exactly same directories as on the original machine, their
paths are hardcoded at linktime.

Install package python2.4 and python2.4-dev. My bet is that the system
is newer and has python2.5 instead of python2.4. Always recompile yade
on the machine where you run it, that should prevent such problems.

Hi,

is the cohesion property of some kind of material (like rock) treated in
YADE?
if so, how it is modeled? bonded model?

Thanks.

    Hello. It depends on the contact law you use...
    For example you could have cohesion in CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw 
(see the files in pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine/). For each 
interaction a value of cohesion "c"  named in fact "shearAdhesion" is 
computed depending on a caracteristic "shearCohesion" (member of the 
class "CohesiveFrictionalRelationships) and on the radii of the bodies 
in contact.
This value of cohesion will then be used for computing a maximum value 
of tangential contact force : Ftmax = c + Fn * tan(phi).

CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw is indeed the law you need, Kan.
Janek added bending/twisting moments to this contact law recently. 
Moments are only elastic for now, but implementing plasticity for 
moments would be just few lines as you have all kinematic variables 
defined already (like the relative bending/twisting rotations between 
bodies).
2 Remarks :
-you need to set collider->haveDistantPersistent=true if you want 
interactions with tensile forces (overlap<0)
-you will have to set interaction->isReal=true in the contact law if you 
want the collider to delete lost interactions (loss of contact means 
adhesive properties are lost and overlap<0, this is equivalent to 
contactForce=0).

There is the brefcom model (in extra) that is supposed to do just that
(cohesion) and is formulated using continuum mechanics (strain/stress)
rather than particles and there is code to make the transition from
displacements/positions etc to normal strain, shear strain and back from
stresses to forces. The material model itself cannot be disclosed, but
you can easily add your own. It is pretty much work in progress now,
however.

For cohesion, make sure you use enable distant contacts in
PersistentSAPCollider and
InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4SpheresContactGeometry. The old
approach would use persistentContacts, but there are (by general
consensus) deprecated and will be removed.

Hi, Dear Jerome,

Thank you for your instruction.
In my contact model, I use the bonded-particle model, so I just assume the
cohension force is modeled in the bond. In that case, the parameter of
cohension c is not explicit shown in the model. maybe it is the problem of
my code.
I will read the code and study how it is modeled in YADE.

Thanks a lot.

Hi!
I need to reset a body's velocity to zero when this body is reloaded into a simulation.
Now can I do it?
As me seems, a velocity of body is sets _only_ by LeapFrogPositionIntegrator or NewtonsDampedLaw.
Both have a firsts vector but different parents...

Hi Sega,

If you need to do that during the simulation with a body which has a 
current velocity, acceleration .. Maybe you could add these lines in 
"LeapFrogPositionIntegrator" (additions in italics)

    Real dt = Omega::instance().getTimeStep();

    /ParticleParameters * p = YADE_CAST<ParticleParameters*>(b.get());/

/    if (p->vel_nulle)
    {
        p->acceleration = Vector3r(0,0,0);
        prevVelocities[id] = Vector3r(0,0,0):
    }/

    if (!firsts[id])
        p->velocity = prevVelocities[id]+((Real)0.5)*dt*p->acceleration;

You have also to declare the parameter /vel_nulle/ as a boolean in 
"ParticleParameter"

finally you can initialise your velocity by adding a line, for example 
in "VelocityRecorder.cpp" (additions in italics)

    for(  ; bi!=biEnd ; ++bi )
    {
        shared_ptr<Body> body = *bi;
        if( body->isDynamic )
        {
            size+=1.0;
            ParticleParameters* pp = 
YADE_CAST<ParticleParameters*>(body->physicalParameters.get());

           /pp->vel_nulle = true;/

            x+=pp->velocity[0];
            y+=pp->velocity[1];
            z+=pp->velocity[2];
        }
    }

Normally it works, I just don't know if that is really fits YADE 
philosophy, maybe the YADE's big boss could comment.

good luck

Lionel

I don't really understand the problem. Can't you just set p->velocity = 
0 somwhere in the code, like Lionel suggests (perhaps not in 
leapfrogIntegrator however, as this feature is really specific to your 
application)?
What/why do you want to do exactly?
It may be even easier using python scripting, but I can't help much on 
this topic currently.

Hello, me too : I copied my sources on my part of this cluster, 
recompiled but encountered this problem also _but_ with 
libpython2.5.so.1.0 :
/./YADE/bin/yade-trunk: error while loading shared libraries: 
libpython2.5.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or 
directory/

Lionel told me about a "preferences .xml" file which cares about 
libraries. I have it on my local session in a hidden folder named 
".yade-trunk" and I discovered in fact that I have this ".yade-trunk" 
only on my local session and not on my part of the cluster. So what is 
the aim of this folder and do you imagine why I don't have it on the 
part of the cluster ? Could this explain these problems of libraries ?

This is linking problem that is done by ld.so when yade is launched,
before yade itself starts. It is not unitl then that preferences.xml
come into play, not before. You can try "ldd /./YADE/bin/yade-trunk" (or
whatever your executable file is), it will show you what files it looks for.

For the cluster, you can attach list of packages, output of clean build
of yade and config log, and a few other things:

ldd yade-executable > yade.ldd.txt
dpkg -l | cat > dpkg-l.txt
build-your_version/config.log
scons pretty=0 > buildlog.txt
/etc/issue
uname -a
/etc/apt/sources.list

Or you can give me remote access to the machine (I can connect via
geo.hmg.inpg.fr, firewall should not be a problem).

It is created when yade is run for the first time. It contains files lik
preferences.xml (is automatically created as well), logging.conf,
OpenGLRendererPref.xml, emergency-saved simulations to recover and so on.

No.

Unloaded particles (from hopper, silo, etc...) should be loaded back with 0 initial velocity.

> 0 somwhere in the code

No, because a integrator will set back the old value.
Currently, the veloctiy can not be changed outside integrator.

I propose the following (inspired by Lionel):

To declare the parameter /bool resetVelocity/ in 
"ParticleParameter". If resetVelocity=true a intergator should set the velocity as first time.
And add these lines in LeapFrogPositionIntergator" and "NewtonsDampedLaw":

    ParticleParameters * p = YADE_CAST<ParticleParameters*>(b.get());

/    if (p->resetVelocity)
    {
	firsts[id]=true;
	p->resetVelocity=false
    }/

    if (!firsts[id])
        p->velocity = prevVelocities[id]+((Real)0.5)*dt*p->acceleration;
    
    prevVelocities[id] = p->velocity+((Real)0.5)*dt*p->acceleration;

We can even abandon "firsts" and use resetVelocity instead...
For angular velocity similar flag should be added in RigidBodyParameters...

Are there any thoughts about this?

You could make the vector<Vector3r>
LeapFrogPositionIntegrator::prevVelocities public, then you could change
it from anywhere: reset prevVelocities for particles in question and set
velocity of the particle itself to zero as well.

How and where do you load these particles? If you load/save simulation,
prevVelocities will be empty and the problem doesn't arise.

The particles are loaded through the boot bunker, pass through a reactor and 
unloaded, after which they must again be loaded through the boot bunker. If 
interested, I can mail example video (about 3MB, tell me where).

But this way will be private. In doing so, I must know exactly what integrator 
is used to find it in the engines list. If I decide to use another integrator 
(now I use NewtonsDampedLaw), I will have to modify my engines...

But if we add the resetVelocity flag to ParticlesParameters, then setting the 
required velocity of a body and setting the flag we say algorithm to 
initialize difference schemes again. No need to know about integrators...

Hi, 
    I've just tried some of the file generators of yade . I'm going to build my own discrete element model. Is it a prerequisite to be familiar with C++ in order to build my own DE model(I'm still learning C++ now)? I want to build DE with cohesive law(simulation of such as rock, concrete mass etc.). Is there any shortcut to generate .xml file for my goal. Thank you !

In any case, you need to have some understanding how yade itself works:
what are engines and so on. Scene can be created in c++ or in Python (see
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/SimpleSceneTutorial for comparison - that is
as simple as a scene can be: sphere falling on a box); there are still
some issues with python but for me it works reasonably well and I don't
write scenes in c++ since a few months at all.

In general, it is better if you are familiar with c++ since many things
are not documented and you have to read sources to find out how it works
exactly. If you want to develop a new constitutive law, you will have to
write it in c++.

Ok I see.
I think the simplest way is to scan metabody->engines, get the 
integrator engine and set integrator->prevVelocities[id]=0. The same 
thing is done in some preprocessors, to get TriaxialCompressionEngine's 
member data from another engine for instance.
I don't remember if prevVelocities is private or public atm, perhaps 
you'll need to make it public.
Your solution would do the job, but it will add useless operations for 
all users.

No big deal, as there are only few different engines.
No need to change your code each time, you can test in your engines :

loop on engines {
if (engines->name == NewtonsDamped || engines->names == LeapFrog)//there 
is another way to do that is in latest SVN IIRC
	then do it;
}

Actually, the fact that prevVelocities are inside the integrator could 
be considered a flaw in design...

and the array "firsts" is unnecessary...
and appears a simple mechanism for re-initializing any integrator...

Hmm... As me seems, prevVelocities is specific for leapfrog method.
For another integrator may be another implementation (Gear predictor-corrector as example...)

Given that the kinematics (pos,vel) at time t depends on previous 
kinematics. I don't see how an integrator could compute the motion 
without previous velocity (the result would be independant on e.g. 
initial velocities!).
Yes, different schemes could need vel(t-2dt) instead of vel(t-dt) (or 
both of them), but you always need a "previous" velocity.

Mmmmh...
Perhaps I missed your point. It may be true that some schemes don't need 
previousVel, and in fact it rings a bell for me :

Indeed, even in leap-frog, we could write

v(t+dt) = v(t) + acceleration*dt (in the code, it would read : v += 
acceleration*dt).

where v(t) is the previous velocity, but it's erased as soon as current 
velocity is computed.

This is how I write the second order finite difference scheme usually, 
and I'm still not sure that the equations in Yade are equivalent to this.

I will double-check that point as it could explain why we need unusually 
low timesteps...

I was wondering what the system requirements were (besides a NVedia graphics
card), in order to run the Triaxial Test of 500+ particles that won't cause
a decrease in frame rate or crash the system.

3d view runs in a separate thread, if you have reasonable graphics card
(can really be Intel or ATI just as well) and at least dual-core
processor, it shouldn't drop simulation speed (I think that is what you
mean by frame rate). On system with 1CPU graphics will always decrease
frame rate. If you get crashes of the system, it is bug in the videocard
driver (most likely); and you're probably screwed up since nvidia
drivers (capable of 3d) are closed source. You remedy might be to
display just wire_frame instead of the sptial sphere rendering - that is
much faster.

Not necessarily.

That is quite obsolete (is it on the wiki? shame, should be removed), I
think (I have Intel and it works fine, I used to have ATI and it worked
as well). But it depends on what kind of crashes you get. If it is just
yade that crashes, that is a bug that should be reported to us (but I
never encountered a crash in the GL drawers). If it is your X session
(graphical interface) that crashes, you have a problem with your driver
/ mesa (library for 3d graphics) and so on - elsewhere than in yade. Get
someone who understands Linux to fiddle with that.

yes, I got that from the wiki.  Well I just wanted to make sure before I ran
yade on my laptop (it has a ATI Radeon Xpress1250 video card and 2GB of
memory, is that ok?), before I was running yade (this yade version was
installed a year ago and hasn't been update) a desktop compuer.

Ok...

My opinion today is :

1- Leapfrog integrator does NOT need a separate variable for
previousVelocity, since at each timestep :

  vel = vel + acceleration*dt; //which is equivalent with NewVel =
PreviousVel + acceleration*dt

2- The current LeapFrog equations in Yade are not consistent, because
for translation we have :
/rb->se3.position += prevVelocities[id]*dt;/
and for rotation we have :
/rb->se3.orientation = q*rb->se3.orientation/; //with q defined _based
on rb->angularVelocity_

This results in position X(t+dt) being computed as
X(t)+dX/dt(t+dt/2)*dt, while orientation O(t+dt)=O(t)+dO/dt(t)*dt.
This means that translation is integrated with a 2nd order scheme 
(correct) while
orientation uses a 1st order formulation!!!
Perhaps not really wrong, but surely not optimal.


3- In the contact law, relative displacement is defined based on
body->velocity. Consequence : it does not correspond to the actual
displacement during dt (remember that the displacement is
prevVelocity*dt). This is wrong (or... lets say... one half of order
scheme...).

4- I removed previousVel/previousAngularVel, to get back consistency for
translation/rotation and for body motion/contact kinematics.
Result :
- the scheme is a lot more stable, for the first time in Yade I get
unbalanced force around 10e-7
- and this stability remains true even with dt 6 times larger than before.

Thank you Sega for pointing that out.
I will think about that a bit more before commiting anything, also
please let me know your opinion about this.
Sega : one side effect will be that body->velocity=0 will be enough to
reset a body velocity. :)

Bruno

p.s. I'm sending a modified NewtonsDampedLaw attached to this mail,
previousVel is still in the code but its overwritten with
body->velocity. Could you guys please test it and confirm that it works
well in your simulations?

Message-ID: <20080610205106.hpdt1gds0w44g0kk@cubmail.cc.columbia.edu>

Hi everybody,

I?d like to know if anybody already had problems with some recorders  
like ForceRecorder engine, VelocityRecorder engine etc... this engines  
seem to be constructed on the same basis. By using yade prepocessor   
examples, I found out that this recorders create a document, but this  
document remain empty (no data). The only recorders wich are working  
properly are the stressWallRecorder as well as the snaprecorder, which  
both belong to the triaxialTestEngine.

I?m not an expert in C++ programmation, I just started to deal with  
this stuff one month ago, so I beleive that I must do something wrong.  
Yade is actually  running (one of the last svn subversion) on kubuntu  
8.04 hardy and all the yade components appear to run perfectly on this  
platform.

Thanks a lot for your help,

Ben

Its in fact body->vel which is overwritten with previousVel.
Thus, at iteration N, body->vel represents the velocity at time 
N*dt+dt/2 (and in contact laws, body->vel*dt is the displacement on the 
interval [t, t+dt]).

Did you test it?

"unbalanced force" is an indicator of the proximity to static 
equilibrium. It is (mean force on bodies)/(mean contact force).
Thus, it tends to 0 when the system tends to static equilibrium.

Note that it is not yet the case. I'll try and send a new version for 
testing today, which will enable this.

Hi Lionel,
This problem occurs also with Yade?s default preprocessor, for  
expample with cohesiveTriaxialTest. In this preprocessor file, there  
is two types of recorders:

- AveragePositionRecorder, ForceRecorder, VelocityRecorder -> doesn?t  
work (empty recorded files)

Code used:

void CohesiveTriaxialTest::createActors(shared_ptr<MetaBody>& rootBody)
00557 {
00558 // recording average positions
00559         averagePositionRecorder =  
shared_ptr<AveragePositionRecorder>(new AveragePositionRecorder);
00560         averagePositionRecorder -> outputFile           =  
positionRecordFile;
00561         averagePositionRecorder -> interval             =  
recordIntervalIter;
00562 // recording forces
00563         forcerec = shared_ptr<ForceRecorder>(new ForceRecorder);
00564         forcerec -> outputFile  = forceRecordFile;
00565         forcerec -> interval    = recordIntervalIter;
00566 // recording velocities
00567         velocityRecorder = shared_ptr<VelocityRecorder>(new  
VelocityRecorder);
00568         velocityRecorder-> outputFile   = velocityRecordFile;
00569         velocityRecorder-> interval     = recordIntervalIter;
00570

- TriaxialTestRecorder -> works

The main preprocessor is available in  
pkg/dem/PreProcessor/CohesiveTriaxialTest.cpp; it is also attached to  
this mail.

Since my preprocessor is just on test, I preferred to use as an  
example which is supposed to work properly, and that I'm using as an  
example in order to understand the structure of the recorder egines.

Let me know if some more information is required.
Thanks again your help and time,

Ben

    Hello. The problem is that the lines you wrote in the mail allow 
only to define the Engines which will record all that you want. That's 
neccessary to define them but not at all enough !
    Once they are correctly defined you have to make so that these 
Engines will indeed be executed when they have to. To make simple that 
is done in the lines occuring at the end of the createActors function

    //rootBody->engines.push_back(averagePositionRecorder);
    //rootBody->engines.push_back(velocityRecorder);
    //rootBody->engines.push_back(forcerec);

And as you see they are commented...!! whereas the line about the 
triaxialtest recorder :
rootBody->engines.push_back(triaxialStateRecorder);
(above) is not commented...

In fact these lines allow to access to the list of the Engines of the 
simulation will we be executed every time step (this list is the 
variable "engines" of the "rootBody" object, which you have to consider 
as the whole simulation). And so you have to put in this list (with the 
C++ function "push_back") the engines you want to be executed.
Did you read my small "Getting started" ? ;-) 
Good luck

Jerome

Thanks Jerome,
I try it right now and let you know if I have other issues concerning 
this problem. Sorry for this kind of details, I'm just starting with C++ 
and debugging is always obvious.
Thanks again,
Ben
P.D: yes I read the getting started, that's an excellent first step for 
beginners.

Hi,
I got to the lab, and checked it again. With the CohesiveTriaxialTest, 
once the engines are setup the be run at each loop: uncommented

rootBody->engines.push_back(engine_corresponding_to_the_one_I_want_to_use); the file are created when at the first step (generate step),but when I stop the model they remain empty.
Any idea?
Thanks, 

Ben

If you push the "stop" button during a simulation, the code is going to 
reset every informations in your txt files, corresponding to "forces", 
"positions" and "velocities". Actually the code considers that you're 
going to make another computation, so he creates others "forces" .. 
files, but empty because you're in the first step.
If you want to keep your informations, you can push the pause button, 
afterwards you remove your files from the temporary folder (../bin).

Good luck

Did you try to stop by clicking on "pause" (and not on "stop") ?
    When you click on stop in fact the .xml file is reloaded and so your 
data files are re-created and so in the most of the cases (depending on 
how the data file is opened by the recorder) erase the older data file 
which was filled during your simulation.
If you want to change this you can give a look to TriaxialStateRecorder 
: in the .cpp in pkg/dem/Engine/DeusExMachina/ at this line (l.44 in my 
version) :
ofile.open(outputFile.c_str(), std::ios::app);
the std::ios::app allows to open the data file in an "append" mode. If 
the file already exists it is not erased (defaut mode) but appended

With a pencil and paper...:) And I compile it and run small simulation. 
It looks good visually... I now can't verify this in another way (and how?)..

Ok, It from TriaxialTest. May be unbalanced force a good "official" Yade's test of integrators?

yes, I see..

Everything related to AveragePositionRecorder, ForceRecorder, 
VelocityRecorder, in Triaxial preprocessors is junk code.
Some lines that should have been removed long time ago, no surprise if 
they do nothing.
Those recorders need a list of submited bodies, and I think this list is 
empty in TriaxialTest.

Subject: [Yade-users] LeapFrog integrators
Message-ID: <48513271.3050507@hmg.inpg.fr>


Hello all,

I commited new versions of NewtonsDampedLaw and LeapFrog engines to SVN 
today.
Using the new versions is highly recommended as the maximum timestep you 
can use is at least 4 times larger and convergence is faster.
I could actually run simulations with dt up to 2*criticalTimeStep, i.e. 
with globalStiffnessTimeStepper->safetyFactor = 2, correponding to dt 8 
times larger than before (safetyFactor couldn't exceed 0.25 with the old 
leapFrog algorithm). The default safetyFactor is now equal to 1.

Please report any problem.

Bruno

p.s. If you don't want to update the full yade code, you can always 
download NewtonsDampedLaw.cpp alone and paste it into your sources.
p.s.(2) if you don't know what I'm speaking about, read comments in 
NewtonsDampedLaw.hpp + discussion on "How to reset a body's velocity?" 
in yade-users list.

Hello to all.

The program YaDe we are using is for investigation at the IMAE Road Laboratory, University of Rosario, Argentine.

Using the program I have obtained results. I need to know what each vector of the output file means, related with Force and Wall Stress in Triaxial test.

I am beginning to use YaDe and need if someone can send to me, please, an example of simulation of Triaxial Compression, if it is possible to do with the program.

I am waiting for the answer.

Thank to all.

Subject: [Yade-users] Compiling during a calculation
Message-ID: <4852316A.1090607@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello everybody. I wonder what would happen if I would compile changes 
in source files while some calculations are running. Does this affect 
the current calculations or not ?
I know a simple solution would be to compile with an other name of 
version to create an other executable, but if I don't want do this, what 
happens ?

Thanks

Jerome

If you use recent versions, each column is labeled in the output file :

iteration s11 s22 s33 e11 e22 e33 unb_f porosity

s : stress
e : strain
unb_f : an indicator of stability

For an example of simulation, generate a sample with the preprocessor 
TriaxialTest, and run it.

It will not. Plugins are already loaded (in kernel speak, they are
mmap'ed) and if you overwrite the file with new version, Linux is smart
enough to keep the overwritten version in memory, because it is mmap'ed
into the memory space of a program running. When you run yade again,
however, it will use plugins as they are on disk, i.e. the new ones.

For the same reason you can upgrade your packages while the system is
running.

Message-ID: <225efd590806130651k725f9c35x547efe224d9d51b5@mail.gmail.com>

I am currently using Debian 4.0 and having issues libboost-dev, the current
libboost-dev that was installed using apt-get is 1.33.1, but every time I
enter the following command, I get this in return....

swt110:/# apt-get build-dep yade-svn1365
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
E: Build-Depends dependency for yade-svn1365 cannot be satisfied because no
available versions of package libboost-dev can satisfy version requirements

I'm not sure if I posted to the right thread, since it seems to me that the
wiki is a mess.  so can someone please relocate this to the right thread.
thank you

Hi, since we use foreach.hpp which is in boost >=1.34, you cannot
install from debian package directly, unless you upgrade to lenny. Or
you can checkout from svn, copy foreach.hpp verbatim from 1.34 (it works
fin with the rest being 1.33) to /usr/include/boost and compile.

Regards, Vaclav.

Message-ID: <45213f870806130845r470e436fl1087ad7d3c59d58e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just wonder anybody has ever done the simulation with a fluid boundary? If
so, how do you handle the boundary condition?
since the fluid boundary is different a boundary of wall, because it is easy
to use the f=k*ds to get the force form the wall, and the wall, where the
wall is in a fix shape, is normally different with fluid where the boundary
shape can change at any time.

if you know anybody published this type of papers? please also let me know.
I appreciate it~.

Do you mean a membrane with external fluid pressure on it? In that case, 
you need to modelise the membrane itself, and apply pressure on it.

Thanks, Bruno.

I am not clear how the membrane is modeled (sorry, I havenot seen any paper
about this), so I would like to state my consideration more clear and you
can get my meaning.
What I am considerring of the fluid boundary(static fluid pressure) is that
there is a fluid boundary that the fluid pressure (it is external fluid
pressure force) is applied on the boundary. but I do not know how to model
it, and how to get the boundary force form the fluid. Because under the
Pressure from other sides, the shape of the boundary touching the fluid is
changing, and the particles distribution around the fluided boundary is also
changing, so how to get the force on each particle touching the fluid from
the fluid. Also, the particle may be seperated from the solid part and flow
in the fluid under the simulation, then how to find the new boundary
touching the fluid, it is also a challenge.

Please read again what I wrote: you have to install foreach.hpp by hand.
You can send the exact error you get, if that is not the problem.

You have to install this lib, it is _not_ just header files. In debian,
the package is libboost-date-time1.34.1 (lib) and libboost-date-time-dev
(headers). Have a look at

/home/beautykiller/build-svn1387/config.log

for detailed account on what went wrong. If unsure, mail it to the list
and we will see.

?? What version do you use? There is no such thing as "true" in python;
you can rewrite it to True, though.

For those who are desperate (including me), I've set up a bzr branch
based on lastest svn https://code.launchpad.net/~yade-team/yade/t2.

Use bzr branch to get local copy, bzr diff/commit etc as usual to do
(local!) commits and bzr push to get changes back to the repository at
launchpad (need to have account there).

I've installed libboost-date-time-dev and
libboost-date-time1.34.1 by "sudo apt-get install
libboost-date-time-dev libboost-date-time1.34.1" ,and
in the K menu->system->adept manager ,the status of
libboost-date-time-dev and libboost-date-time1.34.1
are installed.In fact all the packages in the result
list searched for libboost were all installed.

The statement "ok=true" is added into sconstruct by
myself.I thought libboost were installed already so I
changed the flag "ok" to check whether scons can carry
on ignoring the errors on libboost-date-time.

libboost-* 1.34.1-11 replaced the 1.34.1,now all the

Why it happen? Is it another bug or something
incompatible with my kubuntu? Mine is
kubuntu8.04kde4,which is said unstable.What can I do
now? Back to the stable kde3.5?will it better?
thanks!

ok I downloaded 1.34 and copied over the files into my

/usr/include/boost/

directory, but still nothing, is this the correct dirctory?

I just installed g++-4.3 (by accident) and had to fix that. It is in the
last commit (1392). You may need to pass -fpermissive to g++ so that it
doesn't error out on warnings (not sure, didn't try).

Just a note for _everybody on the list_:

I have about 80% (!!!) speedup (from 12.5iter/sec to 20/sec) with
g++-4.3 and heavy optimizations:

scons profile=gcc4.3-opt optimize=1 debug=0 gprof=0 version=trunk
variant=-gcc4.3vector-opt CXX=g++-4.3 CXXFLAGS="-ftree-vectorize
-fpermissive -march=core2" pretty=0

compared to scons profile=opt with g++-4.2 (never tried that one with
vectorization, since it used to crash).

foreach.hpp would've been enough (!; you may get crashes if you have
different headers from the ABI that libs were built with). Yes, it
should be /usr/include/boost/foreach.hpp (it is just this file that you
needed).

You can attach ../build-[yourversion]/config.log if unsure.

let me start over from the beginning,

   1. I followed the installation instructions for debian/ubuntu, to make
   sure all the required packages were up to date by using aptitude.
   2. Then I switched over to "Installation details" and followed those
   instructions, by adding "deb-src ....." to my "sources.list"
   3. I then used "apt-get source yade-svn1365"
   4. Then I ran "apt-get build-dep yade-svn1365" in which got this message
   in return.


   - Build-Depends dependency for yade-svn1365 cannot be satisfied because
   no available versions of package libboost-dev can satisfy version
   requirements

so build-dep is not happy with libboost-dev, where can I download it to
satisfy it?

Sorry for misunderstanding, I thought you were installing from
subversion, that is what confused me. I would recommend getting sources
from subversion and compiling that, though.

Build-deps care only for packages you have installed, not files that you
install outside the packaging system. If you really want to use the
packaged version, you could

1. use boost 1.34 packages from lenny, but that is complicated (add
lenny to /etc/apt/sources.list, use /etc/apt/preferences to prefer
packages versions from etch, and install boost from lenny). Or you could

2. dist-upgrade your box to lenny, if it is under your control (lenny
will be stable soon, anyway), and have boost 1.34 for free.

I've been trying to use the 3 subversions

   1. svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/yade/trunk/
   2. svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk
   3. svn checkout https:/svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk

but non of them work for me, they either fail to connect or time
out.....might be do the government firewall.

Huh... You could also try this: subversion is mirrored (every 6 hours)
into bzr at  https://code.launchpad.net/~vcs-imports/yade/trunk . Make
sure you have recent bzr installed
(http://packages.debian.org/cs/etch-backports/bzr), then doing

bzr branch lp:yade

should get you a fresh checkout.

Too bad you have such problems, but we'll find a way ;-)

Yes, or use shorter form "bzr branch lp:yade" as the page at
launchpad.net says. It will take a while since you will get some it with
history about 200 revisions back. (There are some differences between
checkout and branch, but they are probably not important now:

Hi Everyone,
I've read a old thread about people who were defining an other object 
than box or sphere: tubes, I'm also interested in that kind of element. 
I saw a file with an already advanced code (263-001.bin), is there a 
more recent file corresponding to this "tubetest"? I'm interesting in 
spending some time on it.
Look forward your response,
Best,
Ben

People, plase can you _NOT_ reply to messages in other threads if you
want to start a new topic? Compose new mail to yade-users instead. (no
offense)

Here is a new mail, with my previous mail:

Hi Everyone,
I've read a old thread about people who were defining an other object

I saw a file with an already advanced code (263-001.bin), is there a

Thanks again,

If you want the advanced geometry of the wall, you can be
interested in the possibility of importing geometry from the STL.
Here is example (about 3MB): geo.hmg.inpg.fr/~smilauer/yade/sega-silo-1.avi
Source files attached to this mail.
ps/ don't worry about 'wild' particles from video. this fixed in the last svn.
pps/ see also examples/STLImporterTest.py in last svn.

Hello to all.

The program YaDe we are using is for investigation at the IMAE Road Laboratory, University of Rosario, Argentine.

Using the program I have obtained results. I need to know what each vector of the output file means, related with Force and Wall Stress in Triaxial test.

I am beginning to use YaDe and need if someone can send to me, please, an example of simulation of Triaxial Compression, if it is possible to do with the program.

I am waiting for the answer.

Thank to all.

Balestrini, Guillermo.
Argentine.

Bruno, in function to your answer, "If you use recent versions", of my previous consultation, it interests to me to know if some new version of YaDe exists. I am working with YaDE 0.11.1, but is this the most recent one?

If a new version exists I want to know the address from where I can download it.

There has not been a release beyong 0.11.1, but there is our subversion
repository:

http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Quick_subversion_tutorial#Download_with_read-only_access

You can download development snapshot, which is bleeding-edge, but
generally reasonably stable. Use the sources you get with subversion as
usual, to compile and install.

Hello, I don't fully understand your questions.
It sounds like you did run a TriaxialTest, but at the same time you are 
asking how to do it. I'm a bit lost.
Please send more precise questions (and perhaps define a subject for 
your mail).
And note that using latest SVN version is highly recommended.

I'm pasting a mail that I sent on this mailing list few days ago :

If you use recent versions, each column is labeled in the output file :

iteration s11 s22 s33 e11 e22 e33 unb_f porosity

s : stress
e : strain
unb_f : an indicator of stability

For an example of simulation, generate a sample with the preprocessor 
TriaxialTest, and run it.

Hi,

I am install the YADE and compile the source, while my hard drive has 1.1 GB
space, and before the compiling is finished, I hase only 400MB left, I am
not sure whether totally 1.1GB is enough or not. Anyone knows?

On my disk, the version with debugging symbols (default) takes about
1.5GB in the build-* directory and 505M in the install directory. For
the stripped version (which is, normally, the optimized one), it is
220MB+65MB.

I would recommend having both compiled and installed, since crashes
(yes, a crash _can_ happen in yade) give you backtrace in debug mode.
And if you optimize, your code is 2-3 times faster.

Getting 2GB extra disk space is just deleting a few photos/music/videos
from your disk, right?

That has nothing to do with the error, as far as I can tell. The
following is more interesting, though:

Obviously, it is a compiler bug ("internal error"), albeit triggered by
some piece of code in yade. I would do try the following: 1. do a clean
build (scons clean, then scons); 2. upgrade g++ to at least 4.2 (there
are gcc-snapshot packages in debian and newer versions may be available
in www.backports.org as well 3. STFW otherwise.

Please keep us posted if this compiler bug can be worked around
trivially, by some small change in yade code (unlikely, though).

Best regards, Vaclav

Hi, in English this should be called "error" rather than mistake
(someting implying a person doing the mistake).

You need to paste compiler messages before the lines that you posted,
otherwise no one is able to help you.

Message-ID: <07200ABDA779AA41BD5747E1FE9E0A09185165@kstud7.utk.tennessee.edu>

Hi, all:

I am thinking of making a livecd for YADE so that it will be easier for anyone trying to demonstrate or use YADE before spending days compiling it, but there are several problems:
(1) The 3D graphic driver, I don't know if any Linux distro can come with a 3D integrated driver, otherwise we can still make it work using software rendering.
(2) The specific Linux distro, I am still running Fedora Core 4 and CentOS 5, however I wonder if anyone have an idea on which is the best platform for YADE? I know a lot of people like Ubuntu.
(3) The YADE version, I only have the experience on the current version at wikia, does anyone think it the best version to come with the livecd? or use the latest svn?

Above are the issues I thought of, welcome any other suggestions. Currently I am just planning, it will take might some couple of weeks before start.

Hi,

for ubuntu, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
(well, you should make a script to automate that, since yade is
evolving). I have no experience with doing that though.

Ubuntu has 3d drivers for Intel, and the open-source ones for nvidia and
ATI. You can install proprietary nvidia/ati drivers by apt into the
image, I believe. You will have to find out what packages etc. The
yshould be picked up automagically on bootup.

I would use latest SVN, it is quite stable for me. (Hey, how about a
release?)

Take space you need into account, also whether you will use the debug or
optimized build. I assume you want i386 as arch?

scons: building terminated because of errors.
kan at kang-laptop:~/datafile/yade/trunk-svn1413$

I have tried several times, and when it stop I just re-run "scons
PREFIX=/home/kan/datafile/yd jobs=6 optimize=1" and it will move on, but
still stop at this error information:
"scons: *** [/home/kan/datafile/yade/build-svn1413/core/yade.o] Error
1        "

I do not know what lead to this problem, my computer configuration(Laptop
which is AMD Turion 2 x core, Kubuntu 8.04 and GForce video card), or some
dependent packages are not installed (but the checking at the beginning of
compiling are ok except the C++ library log4cxx, boost_python-mt, and
boost_python are "no".)

do you know what is the problem from and any suggestion?

Thanks very much.

Please run with jobs=1 pretty=0 and post relevant lines of output. In
what you gave us, the error message is probably somewhere above the
other jobs being started. Most likely you have some linking issue.
Thanks, Vaclav

Hi, Vaclav.
Tell me please, whether there was now way off-screen rendering from the player? 
I want to see animation for more than 20 simulations with a single perspective. 
Is it possible to automate such as this work?

 Hi, YADE guys,

I would like to share the reason that why this happen.
I check the compile history again, I found that it needs a boost/regex.hpp ,
then I install this then it solve.
well, this is not in the check list, so I did not notice this.
maybe somebody also meets this problem, then I hope this is an useful
information.

Regards.

Hi, there is only a small note in the qglviewer documentation
http://artis.imag.fr/Members/Gilles.Debunne/QGLViewer/refManual/classqglviewer_1_1Camera.html#504c573cdd26be8b717a6da9fdb41812
but apart from that I have no idea how to do that. Perhaps asking
upstream might help?

(Had some thoughts about x3d (dump positions from player to x3d, then
feed that to x3d viewer..., but no time for that now).

Sidenote: for my part (I think it is the video card issue), in order to
get correct output form player, the window must not be minimized or
covered by another window during the whole playing. I think therefore
that offscreen rendering would not work for me either.

Vaclav

Hi,

I too am interested in a liveYADE, recently a colleague of mine brought to
my attention a live Debian distro called Paipix which has multiple drivers
for ATI and Nvida graphics/video cards and lets you choose which driver you
want to use at boot.

I think a Debian distro or Unbuntu distro with multi-drivers is the way to
go (paipix is just one example).  Currently I am experimenting with Sidux
(Debian sid distro) and Kubuntu, using Kubuntu I was able to download YADE
using *bzr branch lp:yade* and hopefully I can get it installed and produce
a liveCD.

It would be perfect if we could use Kubuntu as it is what most of us are 
using right now. From my previous experience, I'd say Kubuntu (or 
Ubuntu) works perfectly on live CD (I'm not sure about graphic cards 
drivers though...).

Hello to all.

I download the Subversion, but on having compiled the same one me this mistake appears.

I need if you can say to me because this one passing this.

libsqlite3-dev package is new build dependency I introduced yesterday
(for SQLiteRecorder and player). For wm3, make sure you run scons with
useMiniWm3=1. That will use our in-tree version (it is the default, you
must have fiddled with that, right?).

Oh, _please_ record exactly all commands you use to create the live cd
(downloading live ISO, uncompressing etc, downloading yade, installing),
it would be great if as result, we would have a script that could be run
easily to have all up-to-date.

No, I didn't fiddled or touch anything, just sudo aptitude the required
packages and ran scons, disctcc compiler wasn't installed so i had to
install that and that was it.

No, that is OK. You use distcc but it is useless since there are not
computers it can connect to. I suspect that you have a leftover
scons.profile-* files in the directory and the configuration (for wm3
and for CXX="distcc g++" and such) is picked up.

Subject: [Yade-users] offscreen rendering
Message-ID: <4879118E.8060606@arcig.cz>

Hello,

I did some work on replaying simulations from python which make it
possible to run offscreen rendering. You need the very last svn for that
(1426). I put some instructions into gui/qt3/QtGUI-Python.cpp and more
or less the same at
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/New:Making_videos#Using_SQLiteRecorder.2C_with_offscreen_rendering
.

I would like people to try the Xvfb offscreen thing since it only
half-works for me (I get errors from the X server or the rendering is
not complete), but I strongly suspect the videocard to be blamed.

Regards, Vaclav

Subject: [Yade-users] Attributes of CohesiveFrictionalContactInteraction
	(bug ?)
Message-ID: <487DE835.4040008@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello everybody. I just noticed that the class 
"CohesiveFrictionalContactInteraction" (in pkg/dem/Engine/EngineUnit/) 
inherits from the "_ElasticContact_Interaction", whereas in the 
registerAttributes (of CohesiveFrictionalContactInteraction) what is 
called first is :
_SimpleElastic_Interaction::registerAttributes();

It seems to me that it is quite not logic...
In fact some of the attributes which belong to 
CohesiveFrictionalContactInteraction through ElasticContactInteraction 
(but which are not in SimpleElasticInteraction) are however registered 
(like tangensofFrictionAngle for exemple), but the work is not perfectly 
done : for example "ks" is not registered.
Fortunately it seems that this doesn't affect the computations because 
in the CohesiveFrictionalRelationships we have (if the interaction is 
"new" or not) :

contactPhysics->ks = contactPhysics->initialKs;

In fact this case occured also for the ElasticContactInteraction, and 
was corrected in revision 1315 (14/04/08). But because such commits (in 
which the list of registered attributes are modified) prevent users to 
reload saves, once update is done, (I take the opportunity to say that 
this is a BIG disadvantage of Yade) I didn't want to take the 
responsability of commiting the corrections myself.

Thank you for the remark. I added "ks" in registered parameters. It 
should be enough to fix the problem, shouldn't it?
There is no real reason to consider this a bug. Registering 
ElasticContactIntercations would need extra disk space for variables 
like "equilibriumDistance", which are in fact useless in the current 
cohesive-frictional law.

"Fortunately" is the good word... as there is really no reason to set

contactPhysics->ks = contactPhysics->initialKs

when contacts are not new.

We can now load simulations even when some parameters are not defined in 
the xml. The object will have default constructor values. At least this 
what I'm doing....

It would be... but it no problem really, you can load your good old 
xml's (without ks), even after I added ks as registerable parameters.

In such case, perhaps you could talk about a possible commit on the 
mailing lists, then wait a day or two to see how people react, and then 
commit. One day you will have to anyway. :)

Ok, that's in fact a detail, but so why making 
CohesiveFrictionalContactInteraction inherit from 
ElasticContactInteraction if not all its arguments are used ? To not 
define again an other class which would be "intermediate" between 
SimpleElasticInteraction and ElasticContactInteraction ? (this could be 
a reason, indeed)
Thank your for your response (and for the commit...)

is there an alternative way to download the snapshots of yade?

Your network doesn't probably allow this traffic; since I think that
branching runs over plain http by default: are you behind a http proxy?
If so, have a look at http://bazaar-vcs.org/ConfiguringBzr (set
http_proxy env variable or set http_proxy in config file to make it
permanent). Does wget work for you on some arbitrary file?
>  is there an alternative way to download the snapshots of yade?
There are weekly snapshots here: http://geo.hmg.inpg.fr/~smilauer/yade/
(it is debian source repository; you can use it with deb-src in
/etc/apt/sources.list or just download tarballs with sources). You could
event use the source package for the whole building process:

add deb-src http://geo.hmg.inpg.fr/~smilauer/yade/ to
/etc/apt/sources.list, then "apt-get source yade-svn1431", "cd
yade-svn143_1", "fakeroot-tcp debian/rules binary" and you should end up
with 3 packages (optimized, debugging and headers).

Try with latest SVN, that should work fine. The 0.11 release is ages old
and we're heading towards a new one. The steps to follow are here:
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_of_yade_on_debian_/_ubuntu#From_current_.28.3E.3D1274.29_Subversion

Let us know if that works, or contact us at IRC: yade at irc.freenode.net

The Ubuntu scons has an incompatible version number with the scons script provided in the yade package (homepage), if you do not want to use svn, download a local copy of scons (0.97 version, so in your yade source dir there should be a folder named scons-local), put it in the yade source directory, then following the README file:

Then modify the build/install instructions for your package to instruct your users to execute SCons as follows (if you installed this package in your top-level directory):
        $ python scons.py
Or (if, for example, you installed this package in a subdirectory named "scons"):
        $ python scons/scons.py

For example, the command 
"scons PREFIX=/home/jpvassal/YADE optimize=1"
should be replaced with
"python scons-local/scons.py PREFIX=/home/jpvassal/YADE optimize=1"
just replace the "scons" name with "python scons-local/scons.py"

However it is not a good way, could someone update the http://download.berlios.de/yade/yade-0.11.1.tar.gz file on the homepage?

BTW, if you are using Intel or ATI video card for Ubuntu Hardy heron, disable Compiz by - right click on the desktop, select "Change Desktop Background", click "Visual Effects", click the "none" option. Otherwise all OpenGL apps will mess up~~~

GOOD NEWS!!!

I was successfully able to create a Live CD with yade on it.

BAD NEWS!!!

Yade crashes every time an example is generated and ran, here is the error
message:

EDIT:

Just to be sure, I tested the Live DVD on another laptop and it runs
perfectly, no crashes.  The first laptop that Yade crashed on is a:

Dell Latitude D830
Intel Centrino Dual Core
2Gig of Mem
Nvidia Quadro Video/Graphics card (I'm not sure)

the second laptop which Yade runs perfectly on is a:

Acer Extensa 5420
AMD Turion 64 x2
2Gig of Mem
ATI Radeon Xpress 1250 Video card

I would like to test the Live DVD on some other machines and hopefully
shrink it down some to fit on a CD.

Regards,
Daryl

Message-ID: <163d22d80807270757x77819078h907c3409e2562dee@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I am trying to install YADE-0.11.1 in ubuntu 8.04 with a scons version  0.97.0,
but with some bad experience. When I typed in the following in the terminal:
	
	 scons PREFIX=/home/jidong/YADE optimize=1

I got the following errors (I have mannually changed the sconsVersion='0.97.0'
<line 28 of SConstruct> to avoid yet another error):

scons: Reading SConscript files ...
TypeError: <lambda>() takes exactly 5 arguments (6 given):
  File "/home/jidong/Desktop/yade-0.11.1/SConstruct", line 102:
    Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env))
  File "/usr/lib/scons/SCons/Options/__init__.py", line 285:
    lines = filter(None, map(format, options))
  File "/usr/lib/scons/SCons/Options/__init__.py", line 284:
    return self.FormatOptionHelpText(env, opt.key, opt.help,
opt.default, actual, opt.aliases)

After spending a lot of time searching on the net, I just got one guy
saying that
there will be mismatch of arguments of the functions without giving
any further suggestions
on fixing it. Feel pretty frustructed with the much time wasted so far.

Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks.

Cheers.

Hi,

You can either use the scons-local command as described here:
http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/yade-users/2008/001142.html

or use the latest SVN, it should not have problem on kubuntu or ubuntu, your problem is caused by incompatible version of scons between scons.97 and .98 or above

Hi, you can use the 0.12 release candidate, available at
http://beta.arcig.cz/~eudoxos/yade/yade-0.12rc1.tar.bz2, release
candidate for 0.12.

It is snapshot of latest subversion.

Yes, you did. How can you untar to /usr/share - with sudo? Don't do
that. Keep /usr for package-installed things, use /usr/local/ for things
you install by hand. Boost is packaged, run this to install all
necessary  packages:

sudo apt-get install scons libqt3-mt-dev qt3-dev-tools freeglut3-dev
libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev
libboost-regex-dev fakeroot dpkg-dev build-essential g++
libboost-iostreams-dev liblog4cxx9-dev python-dev libboost-python-dev
ipython python-matplotlib

(from http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_of_yade_on_debian_/_ubuntu)

The running scons will work.

Read some decent tutorial on UNIX/Linux command-line, filesystem layout
and so on, you will need that further way down.

Sorry for this second email, i did a mistake on my mail adress in my
previous question. So you were not able to answer me (It's a pitty :)) )

Thank you for your help.
Now scons is working. But I still have some troubles with the boost library.
First i tried to do as indicated on Yade website on Wiki: I used the
package manager to add libbost library. But when I try to install Yade, all
boost libraries are note found i for example have this type of message:
Checking for boost::thread::thread() in C++ library boost_thread-mt... no
Checking for boost::thread::thread() in C++ library boost_thread... no
I hade a look in usr/lib/ directory on my computer and all the libraries
are there but names libbost**** instead of boost****
So in a second time i tried to go on boost web site to download boost_1_35_0
I untar the file in usr/share/ directory and i tried to install this.
Sorry i'm very beginner in linux so i probably did stupid things. In fact i
tried to do:
./configure
make install

And when i once again try to install Yade using scons... I still have the
same problem. I mean that libraries can't be found.

Did I do something wrong?

Try with latest SVN, that should work fine. The 0.11 release is ages old
and we're heading towards a new one. The steps to follow are here:
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_of_yade_on_debian_/_ubuntu#From_curr
ent_.28.3E.3D1274.29_Subversion

Let us know if that works, or contact us at IRC: yade at irc.freenode.net

Thanks for helping me;
Unfortunatly, i already tried to follow this instructions and the message I
get are :

(No candidate version found... Impossible to find the package... And so on)
And then when I try to install Yade, so libraries are not found :

Yade version is `0.12rc1', installed files will be suffixed with `-0.12rc1'.

Yes, you did. How can you untar to /usr/share - with sudo? Don't do
that. Keep /usr for package-installed things, use /usr/local/ for things
you install by hand. Boost is packaged, run this to install all
necessary  packages:

sudo apt-get install scons libqt3-mt-dev qt3-dev-tools freeglut3-dev
libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev
libboost-regex-dev fakeroot dpkg-dev build-essential g++
libboost-iostreams-dev liblog4cxx9-dev python-dev libboost-python-dev
ipython python-matplotlib

(from http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_of_yade_on_debian_/_ubuntu)

The running scons will work.

Read some decent tutorial on UNIX/Linux command-line, filesystem layout
and so on, you will need that further way down.

Regards, Vaclav

Hi,

For about a week there have been problems with yade-users mailing
list. I'm trying to figure it out, asking berlios admins for help.

Sometimes it's impossible to send a message here. I hope that this
will be resolved soon.

Hi,

You need to edit the repositories list in either you package manager or
manually edit the sourses.list file with the command

*vim /etc/apt/sources.list* ------------- if you are using a debian based
linux

depending on your linux distro you might need edit it as root or if your
using ubuntu based system use sudo, and you don't have to use *vim*, you can
use your own favorite text editor.

In Ubuntu, run Synaptic (menu System/Administration/Synaptic package
manager; or from terminal: sudo synaptic), then menu Settings/Sources,
add the "universe" and "multiverse" components. Then reload package
lists and all that should install just fine.

Message-ID: <07200ABDA779AA41BD5747E1FE9E0A0918517E@kstud7.utk.tennessee.edu>

Hi,

I here provide a piece of information to those using Ubuntu Hardy Heron (gnome desktop). I have a new laptop which comes with Intel (GM965) x3100 integrated video card (It is said ATI cards has the same problem), Hardy will automatically recognize the Intel driver, however, any application using OpenGL does not work right. After searching the web I found it caused by Compiz (although I understand Compiz's argue that it is not his fault), the complete bug report is as described here:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/96991

So if you want YADE's direct rendering to be fine, disable compiz in Ubuntu by:
Right click on the desktop, select "Change Desktop Background", click
"Visual Effects", click the "none" option.
OR other equivalent command in console.

Hope this information will help.

Feng

ok, I hope that the problem is solved. But if anybody has it again,
please mail me in private.

The easiest would be if you could put the iso on your university's
server. Otherwise, I can provide hosting at my university which has
10MBit (or 100?) link - contact me privately by mail and we will arrange
on how you could upload that file.

I hope you have scripts for all the setup so that the CD can be updated
with a few commands automatically.

Hello to all.

I am working with YaDe-svn 1440. I have problems for run the example the TriaxialTest, because I cannot obtain that the walls interactuen or compress the spheres.

I want to know if they know algun problem or it is necessary to to activate algun special parameter in order that this happens.

Simultaneously, in the output file of stress, the stress S11, S22, S33 are always 0.

I am interested in knowing, in that it forms you define the "porosity"

I am waiting for the answer.

Thank to all.

It may be due to a bug that appeared recently : interactions will be 
like "disabled" if you mix two different types of containers for 
persistent and transient interactions (resp. 
InteractionHashMap/InteractionVecSet).
Previously, TriaxialTest was mixing the two types, and it was working 
fine, but now it does not.
After r1447, TriaxialTest uses only one type of container - in principle 
: InteractionVecSet.
So, you can upgrade your SVN version, or just edit the Triaxial.xml and 
replace by hand "HashMap" by "VecSet", it should load and run correctly 
again.
If it doesn't fix the problem please let us now.

UPDATE:

Well I've create a few test images, however they are DVD size, my goal is to
get it under 700MB, so far my latest attempt got it down to 985.7MB.
Heres a list of what I took out:
openoffice.org* (*=all libraries associated with openoffice.org)
kmag
karm
knotes
digikam
kmail
ktorrent
kaffeine
amarok
kdebluetooth
libkbluetooth0
libbluetooth2
kopete
korganizer
kaddressbook
keep
desktop-effects-kde
akregator
konversation
kontact
kppp
kvkbd
kscreensaver
language-pack-(all language packs but english)

In total I was able to free up 568MB of 692.5MB, *however*, after getting
the required libraries, including sqlite3 libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev (I
think these three should be included in the installation instructions in the
wiki) and unpacking them (total size 537MB), and compiling yade-0.12.rc1,
the size goes over iso image goes over 700MB.

If you have any suggestions on what else should be removed please let me
know asap, I only have a week left to get a final version out.  Also I'm
thinking of removing java and aptitude, please note that all the packages
and libraries I removed can be reinstalled later with apt-get, if you choose
to install Kubuntu with Yade on your computer.

Message-ID: <880174.35481.qm@web15807.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>


Hello everyone

Now I wanna buy a new computer(not a workstation) to
run Yade specially. Could you give me some suggestions
about the Computer Components? I mean what type of cpu
is more suitale, how much memory is needed, ... and so
on.

1>Does Yade support the Quad-Core CPU or Dual-Core
CPU? Maybe it depends on whether the linux kernel
support it,is it right? 

2>How much memory is needed if the number of spheres
around 200k? Is there a approximate relationship
between the memory and the spheres number?

3>Does the graphics card necessary if I close the
raphic effect? or some common graphicscard-onboard is
enough?

Thank you all!

Zhang Lin

2>How much memory is needed if the number of spheres
around 200k? Is there a approximate relationship
between the memory and the spheres number?

I think since modern OS uses virtual memory there should be no exact limit for # of spheres, there is an approximate relationship between # of spheres (X) and computation time (Y), it is a quadratic relationship based on my previous test. According to your described hardware (a general computer), I think a reasonable upper limit on # of spheres should be between 10k~30k, that will limit your computational time to several days instead of weeks. But I think a better choice is start your analysis using 1 or 2 thousands, several hundreds or even several tens, I don't think it is good to rush into many many number of particles before you are sure everything is working as you expected.

3>Does the graphics card necessary if I close the
raphic effect? or some common graphicscard-onboard is
enough?

You can disable Open graphics by using the null GUI. But YADE uses 2 independent threads for graphics and DEM calculation, so the computation time is the same if you use the null GUI on a single computer. 

Good luck!

Hello,

We are glad to announce the new release of YADE 0.12. 

It has major improvements: QT3 interface was refactored and python
scripting console was added. It is now possible to control most of
the simulation from within a python script. Clipping planes were
added to graphical view and plotting of resultant curves is possible.
New moment rotation law for DEM spheres was added and fully tested.
The DEM triaxial test was improved in many aspects. Finally an STL
entity importer was added making it possible to import shapes from
e.g.: blender 3D modeling software.

ugh.

s/ChangeLog/NEWS/

I have put a file name in ChangeLog (and class name too). But it's
not in NEWS. 

So, how about listing only few relevant classnames in NEWS *and*
ChangeLog?

Hello to all.

I am working with YaDe-svn 1455.

The doubt is to that it is defined as ?radiusControlInterval? in the input of data of the TriaxialTest. This must to that we did not find relation between the value that we entered like ?radiusControlInterval? with the radius of each generated sphere.

I want to know if a test tube can be generated cylindrical, because I read in mails that was studying this possibility

I am waiting for the answer.

Thank to all.

Hello to all.

I am working with YaDe-svn 1455.

The doubt is to that it is defined as ?radiusControlInterval? in the input of data of the TriaxialTest. This must to that we did not find relation between the value that we entered like ?radiusControlInterval? with the radius of each generated sphere.

I want to know if a test tube can be generated cylindrical, because I read in mails that was studying this possibility

I am waiting for the answer.

Thank to all.

Hi,
Today I have installed YADE, without any error message.But having silly problem,

YADE folder>bin,include,lib
in bin folder>yade-0.12rcl....executable file

I have followed the following step
cd YADE/
cd bin/
../yade-0.12rcl

and found
:~$ cd YADE/
rana at ubuntu:~/YADE$ cd lib/
rana at ubuntu:~/YADE/lib$ ./yade-0.12rcl
bash: ./yade-0.12rcl: No such file or directory

Is there any mistake?Any idea will be appreciable.

Regards,

Hi All,

"radiusControlInterval" is a variable of the triaxialStressController 
engine which is used in the TriaxialTest via the 
triaxialCompressionEngine (which inherits from the the 
triaxialStressController). These engines are used to compress a sample 
by expanding radii of the spheres (or let move the walls also). And 
during the compression all "radiusControlInterval" iterations  the 
stresses are computed for example (to see if the level of stress 
required is reached or not for example) . See the source files :

/TriaxialCompressionEngine if you want to know more

Hello to all.

Jerome:

I am working with YaDe 0.12.0 now.

I need to reproduce in the program, tests(essays) already realized with equipments(teams).

I want to generate particles of size 2 mm. with a certain dispersion of 10 %.

I input the information to the TriaxialTest, density, modulate of elasticity, angle of friction, but the spheres that are generated do not agree what I wish.

My question is, I can control somehow the size of the spheres that the program generates to travez of an algorithm. If the response is positive, since place?

I am waiting for the answer.

Thank to all.

ouch, actually I didn't look at the error message. It says that it
cannot connect to internet and download latest scons version.

Vaclav do you think that you could so something to prevent such
problems? Or write a nicer error message.

If I understand correctly, you are not speaking of PFC3D, you are 
speaking instead of an example PFC3D program for simulating triaxial 
tests (there is nothing as a triaxial test in PFC3D itself, there is 
just balls and walls).
The difference matters : I know PFC but I never looked into example 
files, so I can't see precisely what you refer to.

In TriaxialStressController.cpp, each wall is controlled independently 
to reach a target stress. Nothing prevent you from setting different 
target values for different directions (it has to be coded however, 
because there is one unique "lateralStress" in 2 directions for the 
moment, you need to split this variable into 3 if you want different 
target stresses in different directions).

No problem. I don't work in fact with yade-0.12 but in my version of the 
TriaxialTest.cpp I have a variable "importFileName"  which would help 
you. These "import files" are text files in which are stored all the 
informations about the spheres of your numerical sample, precisely and 
respectively : the X,Y and Z coordinates of the centers of the spheres, 
then their radius.
The best for you is so to create yourself your own import file 
corresponding to what you want, put it in YADE/bin (I think) and type 
its name in "importFileName". Otherwise (if this importFileName is not 
defined by the user) this list of informations is generated by the 
Preprocessor, via a "GenerateCloud" method, and it is not surprising 
that it doesn't generate what you want.

For all that, see these lines at the end of the "generate" method of 
TriaxialTest (and at the end for the definition of the GenerateCloud) :
NB : a BasicSphere is couple of a three real vector : the coordinates of 
the center and a real : the radius : ( (X,Y,Z),R)

    vector<BasicSphere> sphere_list;
    if(importFilename!="") 
sphere_list=Shop::loadSpheresFromFile(importFilename,lowerCorner,upperCorner);
    else message+=GenerateCloud(sphere_list, lowerCorner, upperCorner, 
numberOfGrains, 0.3, 0.75);
   
    vector<BasicSphere>::iterator it = sphere_list.begin();
    vector<BasicSphere>::iterator it_end = sphere_list.end();
           
    for (;it!=it_end; ++it)
    {
        cerr << "sphere (" << it->first << " " << it->second << ")"<<endl;
        createSphere(body,it->first,it->second,false,true);
        rootBody->bodies->insert(body);
    }

as a workaround you can write:

  export NO_SCONS_GET_RECENT="true"


before invoking scons to compile.

Hi,

vector<BasicSphere> sphere_list;
if(importFilename!="")
sphere_list=Shop::loadSpheresFromFile(importFilename,lowerCorner,upperCorner);
    else message+=GenerateCloud(sphere_list, lowerCorner, upperCorner,
numberOfGrains, 0.3, 0.75);

The 0.3 value is the "rad_std_dev" used in GenerateCloud

string GenerateCloud(vector<BasicSphere>& sphere_list, Vector3r lowerCorner,
Vector3r upperCorner, long number, Real rad_std_dev, Real porosity)
...........................
...................
for (t=0; t<tries; ++t) {
            s.second = (random1()-0.5)*rad_std_dev*mean_radius+mean_radius;

It corresponds to the dispersion of the grain size distribution.
That's clearer in TriaxialTestWater where you can find the same lines, but
there the "rad_std_dev" value can be defined as "Rdispersion" in the file
generator menu. You can read the Rmax/Rmin/Rmean values, that correspond to
the value of dispersion you set, in the window "Yade Message" that appears
when you generate a .xml.

Hope it could be useful.
Bye
Emanuele

Better if you send posts to mailing list, not to me directly. I might
had not time to reply. On mailing list others can reply also.

yeah, thats a link to a webpage, unfortunately. You downloaded
a .html not a bzip2 file. I updated the link, I hope that this one
will work.

http://download.berlios.de/yade/yade-0.12.0.tar.bz2

the fix for actual problem that you reported is to change line 46 of SConstruct into:

   tgzParams=("http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/scons/scons-local-1.0.0.tar.gz","/scons-local-1.0.0")

It's fixed in trunk. I hope to release this fix soon as 0.12.1

There is some problem on berlios server which I cannot solve. I think
that they have changed configuration to prevent download of some
files. So I have moved this file somewhere else:

  wget http://geo.hmg.inpg.fr/~janek/images.tar.gz

But this is very outdated. A much more up-to-date information
you will find in two first publications about yade, from yade site.
They evolved from text in that doc.

Hi,


The angleFrictionDeg is not the internal friction angle of a granular material. It is a friction angle as defined by Mohr Coulomb Law. 
I googled for example this one:
http://www.granular-volcano-group.org/frictional_theory.html

If you expected different answer then probably I didn't understand
the output if this translator. This automatic translator is pretty bad.

Hi All,
I have tried to install YADE (svn 1498) and facing problem.At first I want to explain the procedure what I have did.I have followed both way (compilation and installation and building and installation).Later one did as follows-

	sudo apt-get update

Nothing wrong here.
This is a micro-mechanical model, so, input parameters are 
micromechanical quantities that can't be compared directly with 
continuum-equivalent quantities like stresses.

More precisely, the angle of friction in Yade is between bodies (it 
defines the max shear force at contact as fn * tan(friction)).
You computed "angle of friction for state of break with s1 and s3", 
which is of course "function of" but not "equal to" angleFrictionDeg.

Small question, by the way, why did you compare with peak friction and 
not residual friction?

You will need to develop your own preprocessor to do that.

Nothing is goind wrong. *deb are binary packages, you have to install
those with "sudo dpkg -i package.deb". the -dev pkg contains only

maybe you have deleted by accident the ~/YADE-0.12/lib directory?

If so, then you need to compile again, to reinstall missing files. If
the directory is still there, then it means that yade config file got
wrong somehow, and you can try to fix it by running:

  ./yade-0.12.0 -w

The reason could also be that you moved the whole yade dir to a
different directory, which is not supported (and probably will never be).

Hi, all:

I am planning to run YADE on university's cluster, I wonder if there is anyone having such kind of experience? Since YADE has a lot of prerequisites (scons, python, qt, sqlite, etc) and definitely I don't have the permission to install them, is there any solution for this? Or the logic of using hpc clusters are different from PCs?

Thanks a lot!

I'm currently using yade on cluster. But I have told the cluster
administrator what he needs to install to get yade to run:

  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_of_yade_on_debian_/_ubuntu

it's 2*16cores+4*8cores=64cores :) Also 'clusterssh' is a nice tool here.

Fortunately qglviewer is no longer necessary to be installed.

First, thank you for asking. I would give as a general rule :
1- If you are afraid of breaking something, or if you make big changes, 
better create a new processor.
2- If you are confident enough, try modifying the TriaxialTest so that 
the average user (in fact me ;)) will not see any difference.
Something like :

if (newFeatureActivated)
{
   do something new;
}
else
{
   do the same as before;
}

Here, given the amount of changes needed, I'd suggest solution 1 
disregarding your potential confidence.
I'm not even sure you need the TriaxialCompressionEngine, in your case 
TriaxialStressController could be enough (I'm sorry I have no time to 
think to all implementation details, you'll have to find it).

I can't tell precisely if everything is correct in what you sent, but I 
think you get the general idea.

Minor remark :
"sigma1VerticalConfinement" is redundant, why not just 
sigma11/sigma22/sigma33?

More important :
You missed an important part as you apparently dealt mostly with the 
interface and registration of the new variables, but you don't really 
use them somewhere.

In TriaxialStressController, you have this (l.224) :


       Vector3r wallForce (0, sigma_iso*width*depth, 0);
       if (wall_bottom_activated) controlExternalStress(wall_bottom, 
ncb, -wallForce, p_bottom, max_vel);
       if (wall_top_activated) controlExternalStress(wall_top, ncb, 
wallForce, p_top, max_vel);

       wallForce = Vector3r(sigma_iso*height*depth, 0, 0);
       if (wall_left_activated) controlExternalStress(wall_left, ncb, 
-wallForce, p_left, max_vel*width/height);
       if (wall_right_activated) controlExternalStress(wall_right, ncb, 
wallForce, p_right, max_vel*width/height);

       wallForce = Vector3r(0, 0, sigma_iso*height*width);
       if (wall_back_activated) controlExternalStress(wall_back, ncb, 
-wallForce, p_back, max_vel*depth/height);
       if (wall_front_activated) controlExternalStress(wall_front, ncb, 
wallForce, p_front, max_vel*depth/height);

As you see, the prescribed force on each wall is always computed as 
sigma_iso*area. This is where your new stress parameters should be taken 
into account. If i'm correct :

Vector3r wallForce (0, sigma22*width*depth, 0);
if (wall_bottom_activated) controlExternalStress(wall_bottom, ncb, 
-wallForce, p_bottom, max_vel);
... etc

wallForce = (0, sigma11*height*depth, 0);

...

wallForce = Vector3r(0, 0, sigma33*height*width);


You can do this modification in the existing class, if you make sure 
that by default sigma11=sigma22=sigma33=sigma_iso.
Then, you use it in a new preprocessor using non-default sigma values.

Also, I guess you will want an evolution of imposed sigma11 and/or 
sigma22 and/or sigma33 during the simulation.
So, you will need to define this evolution somewhere. I'm not sure now 
if you need to do that in a new class that would replace 
TriaxialCompressionEngine in you preprocessor, or if you can just modify 
the current engine a little bit.
I can't help a lot here because I still don't understand what will be 
your loading path exactly.

Keep posting your suggestions here during the design process, I'll do my 
best to advize.

I hope it is clear.

Hi,
    I want to know if Three Point Bending test works now in the svn version or yade 0.12.0 . By the way, is there any other plugin that is related to continuum media(such as concrete)?

Subject: [Yade-users] Successive slightly different simulations
Message-ID: <48C69AC3.9070308@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello everybody (and especially Luc Sibille ?). The title of my mail is 
surely not very precise so I will try to be clear :
I want to make succesively different calculations over a sample. That is 
to say : considering a sample in a given state (a .xml save...) I want 
to disturb it in a given way (for example compress it), save 
informations related to this compression, and then go back to the 
original state (re-load the .xml) and disturb it in an other way (for 
example : shear it) and again save some things related to this shear...
Because I want to execute more calculations than one load and one shear, 
I'm seeking a way to do this automatically. I think that this is 
impossible with classic engines for example (anyway I don't see how to 
do this by this way). I imagine for example that in the .xml save could 
appear an Engine, with a given parameter, which will care to disturb the 
sample in a direction depending on this parameter but the keypoint would 
be for me to load this simulation many times with always a different 
value for the parameter of the Engine.
Does someone have an idea ? Could python scripts (which I don't know at 
all but it will maybe be the time) help for that ?
Thanks

Jerome

Hi, yes, you can use python for just this.

I will give you an example of using different loading speeds (you can
chage to suit your needs). Label the engine you of which parameters you
will modify (Engine::label) e.g. 'jeromeEngine' (not necessary, but
makes it easiest to find the engine).

o=Omega()
# create the simulation here, save it
# ...
# o.save('/the/original/setup.xml.bz2')
#
# or do nothing it it is already created and saved

# loop over different loading modes
for mode in ['mode1','mode2','mode3']:
    # load the original state
    o.load('/the/original/setup.xml.bz2')
    # get the engine you want to modify
    je=o.labeledEngine('jeromeEngine)
    # change engine parameters depending on the loading mode
    if mode=='mode1':
       je['strainRate']=10
       je['maxStrain']=1e-6
    elif mode=='mode2':
       je['strainRate']=20
       je['maxStrain']=1e-5
    elif mode=='mode3':
       je['strainRate']=30
    # run 1000 iterations and wait (True) until they are done
    # you could use different criterion of when to stop, but this one is
the simplest since it is known beforehand
    o.run(1000,True);
    # print/save the results you need here
    # for example, an internal variable of your engine
    print je['averageStress'],je['sigmaZ']
    # or force actiong on body #50
    print o.actions.f(50)
   
Save the script as something.py and run with yade-trunk something.py.
Get back with questions, Janek already suggested creating a section of
python code snippets on the wiki, but this hasn't started yet.

Hi,

  Why "especially Luc Sibille" ? I'm not sure to be able to help you. In 
addition I am not sure to understand your problem very well.

  When I simulated stress probes with SDEC, maybe I performed something 
similar to your problem. But it was with SDEC!

The general idea was the following one:
- first I created a .txt file: in each row there was a parameter saved 
(for instance, the direction in the stress space of the stress loading)
- Then I included the whole code SDEC in a big loop, like that SDEC 
started and stopped automatically, as many times as wanted.
- Finally each time there was an increment in the big loop defined 
above, the parameter in the row "i" (corresponding to the increment "i" 
of the big loop) of the .txt file was read. The input parameters of SDEC 
were computed with respect to the parameter read.

To do that I used a kind of general engine roughly defined as below:

X axis control:  stress/strain
X stress increment imposed (if stress chosen): 12596
X strain increment imposed (if strain chosen): 0.25

Y axis control:  stress/strain
Y stress increment imposed (if stress chosen): 14157
Y strain increment imposed (if strain chosen): 0.14

Z axis control:  stress/strain
Z stress increment imposed (if stress chosen): 175545
Z strain increment imposed (if strain chosen): 0.75

By this way, for a total stress control for instance, and a parameter 
giving the stress loading direction, the X, Y, and Z stress increments 
were adjusted for each increment of the big loop.

  All that was with SDEC, I don't know at all what would be the solution 
with Yade, but I am sure that it can be much more efficient.

   I hope it helps.

    best

    Luc

Ok ! Now I know it's possible I will first begin by creating my 
"jeromEngine", and then try to use it with Python. I will surely then 
have questions about Python at this time but thanks a lot from now on 
Vaclav for your clear explanations and example !

Luc : as you maybe understood it, I want in fact simulate directionnal 
research with Yade. As you did it with SDEC (isn't it ?) I wondered if 
you tried to do this with Yade also, that's why I thought to you... 
Thanks also for your advices, even if as you pointed it out yourself it 
is difficult to compare Yade and SDEC (but this is not clear for 
everyone ;-)  )

Eh, you don't need special engine. You just take an existing one, and
the easiest is to find it by label. Otherwise you can do like this to
get TriaxialCompressionEngine, for example:

tce=[e for e in o.engines if e.name=='TriaxialCompressionEngine'][0]

(the first expression gets list of all engines of which class name is
"TriaxialCompressionEngine" and the [0] gives you the first (likely the
only one) element in the list). You can read it like math set expression:

{e ?e?{all engines} | e.name=='TriaxialCompressionEngine}, i.e. set of
all e from {all engines} that satisfy the condition.

Then you go ahead:

    tce['sigma_iso']=5e7
    tce['...']=...

You get the idea, right?

I think, yes. But my simulations are quite different from triaxial tests 
: I simulate simple shear tests, so with only two directions of 
solicitations (expressed in displacements and not strains), that's why I 
think that the best for me is to define a new engine even if it will not 
be fondamentaly different from the CompressionEngine one, indeed.
Thanks

Hi, all:

I post this thread just for YADE's installation on clusters or you don't have Admin privilege.
I am trying to compiling YADE0.12 on a cluster, however not having the Admin privilege, the cluster has its boost version of 1.32, but we need 1.34 or later, I compiled a new version of 1.36, in my home folder, say /myfolder/boost136, but how to let the scons know the boost path is this new path? I tried the command: 

scons PREFIX=/data/DEM-CFD/YADE CPPPATH=/myfolder/boost136/include LIBPATH=/myfolder/boost136/lib 

It is still pointing to the default path, how to correct this? Thanks!

Yes, you can, just use different PREFIX, actually you can use the same PREFIX since YADE can identify itself using different version -1X.XX

Hi, I am not sure what you mean by "still pointing etc", can you paste
the ../build-version/config.log? You could also try putting "print
env['CPPPATH'] somewhere after the line "opts.Update(env)" where options
from the profile are copied over to the build environment...

I will try that myself but not before the weekend, sorry :-(

Hi, Vaclav:

Sorry it seems I didn't describe the problem precisely, the situation is, the cluster has its own version of boost 1.32 (Redhat 4.6), when I execute scons, I think scons will look for a boost in the default /usr/include/boost, I think I need to let scons know it should not use the old version 1.32 in /usr/include/boost, but in my new compiled directory (which I have access to): /data/DEM-CFD/boost136, and I tried add the CPPPATH=/data/DEM-CFD/boost136/include and LIBPATH=/data/DEM-CFD/boost136/lib
but when executing the scons, it is not finding the boost 1.36 in that directory but still using the default /usr/include/boost

attached is the config.log, hope it would be useful, thanks!

Hi, I am not sure what you mean by "still pointing etc", can you paste
the ../build-version/config.log? You could also try putting "print
env['CPPPATH'] somewhere after the line "opts.Update(env)" where options
from the profile are copied over to the build environment...

I will try that myself but not before the weekend, sorry :-(

Hi,
      I want to create some cohesive links between rigid bodies(especially the spheres) by using Python Script. Is this goal possible with python(since the python script is much easier than the counterpart C++ code)?
      Do I need to change the property of bodies(metabodies) or use specific engines(metaEngines) or both of them?
 
                                                                                                        xsxcn

Hello

I strongly recommend using transient interactions. Persistent
interactions will be totaly removed from Yade at one point because they
do nothing more than transient ones.
Try using CohesiveFrictionalInteractions. It should be doable with
Python, though I still didn't really try it.

Bruno

As bruno said, use transient interactions. The easiest is to use
collider and corresponding metaengines to create contacts for you.
Creating contacts from python is currently unsupported (o.interactions
is read-only from python), but I can add that, it is a matter of few
minutes -- if there is interest.

Hello Mohammad,

For the moment, the stress-strain control will not work on a rotated box.
But is there really a reason to rotate the box, can't you just rotate 
gravity instead?
If you have no gravity, there are even less reasons to rotate things, as 
the physical problem would be exactly the same (it is easier to rotate 
your screen a little ;)).
Another way is to generate a triaxial sample in xyz axis, then fix the 
boundaries positions and rotate everything (spheres+walls) when 
reloading the sample.

"/*! \brief Controls the stress on the boundaries of a box and compute strain-like and stress-like quantities for the packing

I wonder what strain-like and stress-like actually are. Is it the  Ratio of the sum of the forces near the wall To the area(after deformation)?

Yes it is.
And strain is computed based on current size vs. initial size for each
dimension of the box (epsxx(t) = logarithm(lenghtxx(t)/length(0)).

Hello everybody. I made at last my first attempt today : I have defined

executable "yade-trunk" where is already located the .xml that the

compared to typing only ".yade-trunk"... In the first case also the GUI 
appears and nothing else happens... Here are the outputs of the console :

You must be using some older version, recent ones will abort if there is
problem with plugins. You have to link Brefcom with GlobalStiffness (in
extra/SConstruct: LIBS=...) and recompile. Do a "svn update" if you can,
that's the safest way to run up-to-date code, this doens't happen in
trunk since, as I just checked, Brefcom links against Shop, which in
turns links agains GlobalStiffness.

Otherwise, your script looks fine, although you will also have to save
data from your simulation you want to get somewhere, before you reload.

I've made it : I added'GlobalStifness' which indeed didn't appear in 
this line before:
env.SharedLibrary('Brefcom',['Brefcom.cpp'],CXXFLAGS=env['CXXFLAGS']+brefcomInclude,
                                
LIBS=env['LIBS']+['Shop','InteractingSphere2InteractingSphere4DistantSpheresContactGeometry'*,'GlobalStiffness'*]),
(NB : In my version "Shop" doesn't link to GlobalStiffness)
But this doesn't solve the problem. I've always the GUI which appears 
alone, but the warnings are now different :

Thanks

PS : I gave a quick look to this "Brefcom" I didn't know. It seems to 
deal with contacts but I didn't see where (from which source file) it 
could appear in my simulations... Could this Brefcom nevertheless be a 
problem for me ?
PPS : I would prefer, by laziness I confess, not to update if possible...

This is harmless (and doesn't appear now)... I am not sure whether, at
the ancient version you have, was python console already integrated with
the qt3 ui; make sure you compiled with python support (try running
"yade-trunk -N PythonUI", you should get to plain yade console). I would
strongly suggest upping your trunk, if you have all your code
(DirectShearCis?) in the tree, it will compile and should work just fine.

I attached my scons.config to be sure that the compilation itselve is 
not to blame. But I guess I will have to update..., isn't it ?

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] IMPORTANT: Mailing list migration.
Message-ID: <20080922220956.36ea4566@szpak>

Hello,

There were many problems with yade mailing lists on berlios.de
recently. The fact that they were completely broken for almost two
weeks, a month ago, made use to solve this problem ultimately:
We are switching to launchpad. 

This switch has beed first tested on yade-dev and now we are doing
this on yade-users.


Please see instructions for migration to launchpad:

  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Launchpad_Migration


We want to make this migration as swift as possible:

* all mailing list archives are already imported to launchpad

* both mailing lists will stay SYNCHRONIZED for SEVERAL MONTHS

* this (deprecated) mailing list yade-users at lists.berlios.de will become RECEIVE-ONLY

* every user that will subscribe to launchpad will be unsubscribed
  from yade-users (to avoid receiving each post twice, from both
  mailing lists).

Therefore:

  - if you only want to receive posts (without sending), you don't do anything
    for few months. Afterwards you will need to subscribe to launchpad.

  - if you want to be able to send new messages, you need to subscribe:

    https://launchpad.net/~yade-users/+join

OK, I have unsubscribed from berlios all people who are already
subscribed to launchpad: Bruno, Przewdnik, Sega, Vaclav.

If all went well:
  - you have received previous message twice,
  - and this one - just once.

I will be subsequently unsubsribing people from berlios, who
subscribe to launchpad. Or if you receive messages twice, and don't
want to wait until I unsubscribe you from berlios - you can do it
yourself :)


Now everyone is allowed to send messages only to
  
  yade-users at lists.launchpad.net

I suggest you upgrade anyway, since otherwise it will be bigger pain
once you decide to do that. Plus there was some bugfixing in the python
glue - which I hope will not prevent you from using it.

After a look at the archive of the mailing list I tried with openmp = 0. 
One type of error disappeared but two remain (about bad values (native) 
for -march or -mtune=switch)

- Everything that is sent to launchpad is also forwarded to berlios

- Everything that is sent to berlios (not launchpad) gets a rejection

For example this post by XSX has been rejected:
  "How can I change or add preprocessor's source code?"
please resend it to launchpad :)


I'm sorry for this inconvenience, I think that lauchpad will not have
any problems that berlios had - after all - it is hosting ubuntu
project itself :)



!!!!
One more thing - when you click "reply" please make sure that you
send reply to the mailing list, NOT to a PRIVATE address.

Most modern email clients should have this done automatically, but
better to check by yourself (and see if you can configure your email
client). The lauchpad mailing list does not override the "Reply-To"

Hello

force, velocity, and position files are nothing, don't even mention
them. I thought I removed that from the code already, apparently not...
The only meaningfull file is wallstresses, and you have columns labels
on the first line.

OMG, why are you sending 250kb log? (message limit is 40kb). Try the
same thing without distcc (CXX=g++, or even better CXX=g++-4.3). Distcc
runs g++ on different machines without checking they are at some
particular version. That version of g++ that happens to be called by g++
(the default one) will be used.

this is my bet also - the problem is because of distcc. You need to
talk with each person that has a computer which you are using with
distcc and compare your g++ versions.

simpler to not use distcc. But maybe Bruno has the same version as you?
I have 4.3.1, we might help each other here.

To make sure, always use distcc with explicit compiler version, like
CXX="distcc g++-4.3". That way you will get error if your mates don't
have that version.

Yes, you were right : without distcc I have no problem. But I tried with 
CXX='distcc g++-4.3' and I get indeed error messages because the others 
don't have the same version, but moreover the compilation stops... The 
solution was, with Janek, to change the settings of my distcc to call 
the good neighbours whose I can use their PC...
I should be now next to have the opportunity to use python... Thanks

Jerome

Please, xsx, check the code and documentation first. Sometimes, you will
find what you need.

http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/index.html

Go to "class members" and look for UnbalancedForce, click it, you will
find the class it belongs to, and following details :


Real 	UnbalancedForce
<http://yade.berlios.de/doxygen/html/df/de2/classTriaxialCompressionEngine.html#dc56eba2c1ead52ed16d89d3e29cfe66>

	Max ratio of resultant forces on mean contact force.


Also, don't hesitate to include aditional comments in the code and
commit it when you think something is missing.

Thank you


Bruno

To answer to your question give a look to the source file of the
CohesiveTriaxialTest : CohesiveTriaxialTest.cpp in
trunk/pkg/dem/PreProcessor/. A search about "WallStresses" show you that
"Wallstresses" is in fact the value of the variable
"WallStressRecordFile" of the CohesiveTriaxialTest class : see line 121
(in my recent version) :
WallStressRecordFile = "./WallStresses";
Then this variable WallStressRecordFile is used to define the
"ouptutFile" of the Engine TriaxialStateRecorder :

triaxialStateRecorder =
shared_ptr<TriaxialStateRecorder>(newTriaxialStateRecorder);
triaxialStateRecorder-> outputFile = WallStressRecordFile; (around l.627)

So, let's jump to the source files for TriaxialStateRecorder ! You'll
find them in trunk/pkg/dem/Engine/DeusExMachina/ and you'll find in them
how this file ("WallStresses") is filled (the end of the .cpp with
ofile<< ...). So you'll see that in this unb_force column is in fact
written the result of triaxialCompressionEngine->ComputeUnbalancedForce
(...).
I'm sure you guessed now that you have to open the source files for
TriaxialCompressionEngine ! They are in the same folder, but to avoid
making a too long mail I tell you right now that in fact
TriaxialCompressionEngine inherits from TriaxialStressController (always
same folder), where this ComputeUnbalancedForce(...) is defined. So give
a look to it (? Real
TriaxialStressController::ComputeUnbalancedForce(MetaBody * ncb, bool
maxUnbalanced) in the .cpp) and you will know what it is exactly ! The
idea is that parameter could be used to evaluate the state (equilibrium
or not) of the sample by considering the sum of forces acting on each
body of the sample. In a perfect state of equilibrium you will have 0
and in fact values of some % are generally considered satisfying.

Welcome in YADE !!! :-)

Xsx cannot commit anything yet, because he doesn't have write-access
to our SVN repository! 

Xsx, but nothing prevents you from getting this access :) You only
need to register on berlios and tell me your berlios login name.
So I will add you to the project. Then you will read 

  http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Quick_subversion_tutorial

to learn how to commit.

Then everyone will enjoy your work, and if you screw something up -
don't worry - you can always commit a fix, because SVN remembers all
history of changes :)


The same applies to Nurul in fact :) We don't want to lost your work.

To avoid receiving posts twice, people who subscribed to launchpad
are being unsubscribed from berlios. I'm doing those unsubscriptions
for you.

However few people subscribed to launchpad with hidden email address,
and I don't know what email to unsubscribe from berlios. Those people
will need to unsubscribe themselves from berlios.

Yade will run on any computer (even with 1024 processors), so it is
"compatible", but it always uses only one computing core. Some
parallelization can be done with ParallelEngine class (using openMP),
but speedups are not very clear.

BTW, Sega, I wanted to ask you independently: could you document your
findings on advantages of parallelizing? Did you parallelize
constitutive law as well, etc?

Vaclav


PS. You cannot say "esencialmente" in English; "esentially" is the right
word ;-)

Hi, I was a bit confused sure at that point of talk, but it was a first
"reasonable" explanation as to why forces on top and bottom bodies
didn't match... Finally I think that the conclusion was different (and
in accord with what you say): the top dynamic body had gravity force
downwards and reaction from the bottom body upwards (so the overall
force was almost like 1e-6) and the bottom body had gravity and the
reaction from the top body added, both in the downwards direction.

Regards, Vaclav

PS. I think everybody on the list would be interested, as it is always
nice to see people (me, in this case) saying stupid things, right?

.so is the binary plugin (shared library, "Shared Object" -> .so), which
is loaded by yade. The .os things are intermediary compiled objects that
will be linked to shared library afterwards and are only useful for
building.

If you deleted JeromeFile.hpp, the link is dangling (pointing to
nonexistent file) and is useless. The .so and .os files are equally
useless, unless you want to read machine code... :-( Sorry for bad news.

Luc, I switched to 4.3 because its optimizations are far superior to
what 4.2 has to offer and I had speedups of about 30% just with that. If
you don't want to upgrade (leaving aside the fact, that you can upgrade
only your compiler, using this archive:
https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain/+archive - I suggest that you do
that), you can edit SConstruct file and change "native" to your
architecture for which you want to optimize -- see "man gcc" for the
list of those.

If you upgrade to intrepid, I think you should have no problems. I did
that on two machines, it went smoothly.

Ah, that is my fault, I apologize and will fix that tonight. It would be 
OK if they were not initialized (since they are not used in that case) 
except that our current deserializer chokes on nan's, which is the

Hello Mohammad.

A linear contact model is anything like F = k*U, provided that k is a 
constant.
All equations you mentionned only differ (or not) in the definition of 
k, so _they are all linked with a linear contact model._
I'll try to explain the very few ideas on which most equations below are 
based.

Starting from ref. (03) :

Kn=(kn(A)*kn(B))/(kn(A)+kn(B)))   (eq. 1)

You see here that the stiffness of the contact is in fact the equivalent 
stiffness of two springs A and B, where ka and kb are the stiffnesses 
assigned to each individual grains.

Now the question is : how to define ka and kb?
It is in fact convenient to define them as ki = E*ri, with E a constant. 
The reason is, if you do that, the stiffness of the packing will be 
independant on the size of particles (you can proove that with 
dimensional analysis).

Which writes, based on  eq. 1 :

kn = (E.ra*E.rb)/(E.ra+E.rb) = E*ra*rb / (ra+rb)

This is the equation you have in ref. (02) (with "E" named "K", and 
ra/rb replaced by the mean radius).
If you assigned different values of E to different spheres (a mix of 
hard and soft spheres), it gives the equation in  ref. (04) (except the 
factor 2 that I will comment later, the key point here is just the 
proportionnality between k and the scaling factor r).

ks, is usually defined as a fraction of kn. Say, for grain i, 
ks(i)=Vi*kn(i).

 From equation 1 again, the equivalent tangential stiffness of the 
contact will be :

ks = ksa*ksb/(ksa+ksb) , which is, in a condensed form, the equation for 
ks in ref. (04).

About factor "2" in ref (04) : I added it in the equation so that the 
Young Modulus Ey of the packing was very close to E in one special case, 
but this is not something general. Denser/looser packings will have a 
different proportionality between E and Ey.

If you really want a constant proportionality, you need to replace "2" 
by a function taking into account the properties of the microstructure. 
One method for that, based on the coordination number, has been partly 
implemented in Yade. I can't comment in depth because I did not work on 
this method, but I know it gave this code with coefficients alpha, beta, 
gamma, that you can see in MacroMicroElasticRelationship (and not in 
ref(05) where this is just commented junk code).
So, just take ref (06) as a more sophisticated form of ref (04).

The only expression which - apparently - doesn't fit in this framework, 
is the one in ref (01). I probably miss some details to understand why. 
This equation is not used in Yade. But still, the equation in ref (01) 
defines a constant, so it is relevant for a "linear contact model".

There is nothing fundamental, in fact, in the definition of k. If you 
want k=10000 N/m at all contacts in your simulations, just write a 
ExtremellySimpleElasticRelationship engine that will take values of kn 
and ks as parameters and will assign them to all contacts. There would 
be nothing wrong in doing that.

Last remark, to prevent some confusion :
I just removed this comment in SimpleElasticRelationships.cpp, because 
it was just wrong (it was typed by some guys never using PFC apparently 
;-)) :

//This is the formula used in PFC-3D
   //
   //Real Kn = 4 * ((Ea+Eb)*0.5) * ((Da+Db)*0.5);
   //Real Ks = Kn/2.0;

I hope it helps.

Yes, I will do it, but not as quickly as hoped (most likely, after the new year),
because in December I have a PhD and now I am busy with this basically.
Now I have some observations but need more tests. Raw data is: 
1. Previously I report about 0.44 iter/sec for 90k particles with ParallelEngine and about 0.35 iter/sec without ParallelEngine. But these data were obtained for a static heap problem, i.e. where there is no intense change the position of particle relative to one another .
2. For dynamic problem (a tumbling mill) I get follow:
a) with ParallelEngine - 0.34 iter/sec
b) without ParallelEngine - 0.33 iter/sec
c) Parallel simulation with OpenMP - 0.4 iter/sec
So... It seems that the program needs not so much in MetaEngine cycles parallelization, but needs optimizing algorithms, such as an algorithm for determining collisions...
Another observation: when parallelization with OpenMP a processor load is only about 120%, at the same time EDEM load a processor for all 190%. I think this shows the need for the engines parallelization...

Message-ID: <48FD9229.4070803@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

    Hello. Due to updates a bit stupidely executed I have lost source 
files I wrote myself (say "JeromeFile.cpp" and hpp). I wonder if it is 
possible to get them back. In fact I found that there are always files 
JeromeFile.so and JeromeFile.os in some folders "build", and also links 
towards "JeromeFile.hpp". So I wonder if I could use this by any mean...
    This is also for me the time to ask what are exactly these .so and 
.os files and what is the use of these "build" folders in the running of 
Yade ? Thanks

Jerome

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] DynLibDispatcher: ambigious dispatch
	??
Message-ID: <49003D13.30204@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello. I now become this message during a simulation :

"DynLibDispatcher: ambigious dispatch, could not determine which 
multivirtual function should be called"

In fact the simulation runs but with this message written a lot of times 
per iteration, leading to a very slow rate of iterations per second 
(plus the unpleasant feeling that something is wrong...). I've found 
that this is because of this particular paragraph of the .xml :

<engines _className_="InteractionPhysicsMetaEngine"  label="" 
functorNames="[[CohesiveFrictionalBodyParameters 
CohesiveFrictionalBodyParameters CL1Relationships]]">
                <functorArguments size="1">
                    <functorArguments _className_="CL1Relationships"  
betaR="0.12" setCohesionNow="0" setCohesionOnNewContacts="1" />
                </functorArguments>
</engines>


And more precisely it seems to be due to the use of "my" 
CL1Relationships (simulations with CohesiveFrictionalRelationships for 
example run well) but I didn't find the mistake (moreover before my 
updates I could use these Relationships).

    Does someone could explain me more precisely the sense of the output 
message to help me to find what is wrong ? Thanks

Jerome

Hello Luc. If I remember well, compiling with "openmp=0" will let 
disappear the first type of error. For the two others, it is because you 
don't use the good compiler : you need g++ with version >= 4.3. But for 
that you will surely need to update your Linux distribution (to 
Intrepid). Very sincerely GOOD LUCK !

Jerome

It is no more the case. Because of the changes I've lost during my 
updates (...) my spheres didn't have in fact the right body parameters 
to use the Relationships I wanted. That causes the output of this message.

Thank you Vaclav and Jerome. Sorry to disturb you I am silly, as you said,
an updated version of linux was enough: it works very well.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Worries with freeglut
Message-ID: <49058297.8050204@hmg.inpg.fr>

Hi, I'm now on Debian/lenny, I installed yade.0.12.0 on my computer 
which is:

/Linux c1rosmerta 2.6.26-1-686 #1 SMP Thu Oct 9 15:18:09 UTC 2008 i686 
GNU/Linux/

The compilation goes to the end, but I had a few worries :
- when I want to open the controller, even if I can generate .xml files
- when I want to execute some simulation using NullGui

Each time the following message appears :

/freeglut (./yade-0.12.0): OpenGL GLX extension not supported by display 
':0.0'
/
Any idea ?

Regards

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] SphereContactGeometry with (or
	without) hasShear :	"nan" attributes
Message-ID: <4905C40B.1020809@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

Hello. I have serious problem with this new (for me) version of 
SphereContactGeometry which contains now these variables : pos1, 
cp1rel,... and so on. After a save (in .xml format) it occurs that a 
given number of my interactions (not all, but more than one... I didn't 
count more precisely) contained very strange values for these attributes 
of "SphereContactGeometry". These very strange values could be 1e100, or 
even "nan" which is at least honest enough to avoid me to reload these 
saves (which let me notice that something goes wrong...)
    These problems occur either I define hasShear = 1 (the only case 
where a real value for these variables is computed, if I understand 
well), or I define hasShear = 0...
I guess there should be a problem with the corresponding 
REGISTER_ATTRIBUTE, but my ideas stop here...
Thanks,

Jerome

This is because these attributes are nowhere initialized. Therefore, they contain garbage. I are often faced with such errors too. In doing so, the saved scenes refused to load. I think that MUST be initialized all serializable attributes in the default constructors. Vaclav?

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] OSError: [Errno 17] while compiling
Message-ID: <4906030D.4080508@geo.hmg.inpg.fr>

(NB : No, my email account is not pirated by a spam robot...)

After some work in the source code, and, so, an attempt to recompile I 
get this error message at the very beginning :

Checking for boost::python::scope() in C++ library boost_python-mt... 
(cached) yes (all the former checkings are also to yes)
OSError: [Errno 17] File exists:
  File "/home/jerome/MyTrunk/SConstruct", line 524:
    installHeaders() # install to buildDir always
  File "/home/jerome/MyTrunk/SConstruct", line 491:
    if not exists(linkName): os.symlink(linkTarget,linkName)

I tried again after a scons -c, and also after having commented the 
(two) paragraphs in the "Sconscript" files corresponding to the modified 
source files but it changes nothing...
It seems to me that I already faced this error but I didn't remember 
when (and how to solve it)... I didn't find anything on the mailing list 
and the only thing I understand from the web is that this error could 
occur at every installation of something. Finally and unfortunately I 
understand the "Sconstruct" very very too few to see exactly what goes 
wrong...


Thanks again

You can do this in a more efficient way:

 DeusExMachina('TranslationEngine',{'subscribedBodies':[41,42],'velocity':0,'translationAxis':[0,0,-1]}),
</footnote>

Well, it actually doesn't make much sense to have the body dynamic and
prescribe translation at the same time, does it? The problem of
displacement being infinity is that facets have zero mass (see
o.bodies[41].phys['mass']) and that doesn't do any good to the integrator.

I think that for the wall that does the compression, it would be perhaps
better to use regular box instead of facets; if you have it with
wire=True, you will even still see what is goig on down there.

I am not sure what you're trying to achieve? A box compressing spheres
from above, ok, but if it has contact speed, it will explode at one
point, since no force will stop that box. Wouldn't it be better to
actually prescribe force? But force will be constant, if you want to
change at runtime, you would need something more sophisticated, like
TriaxialTest, but only 1d.

Hi, sadly SDECLinkedSpheres is deprecated due to upcoming architectural
changes (merging transient and persistent interactions) and is known to
be broken. I hope some other people that use similar interction types
would be able to tell you what you consider as substitute for
SDECLinkedSpheres. Regards, Vaclav

I hope others will kick in here... I didn't write any of those.

Read the yade documentation (papers on the wiki) to get idea about the
architecture, then run those simulations or read their XML files or
sources...

Hi, I'm  last year Student of the mechanical engineer carreer, also I with a
partner are doing our memory in DEM, using your software.

we have installed yade sub version 1328 and the version 0.12rc1 and in both
version we have problems with SDEClinkedSpheres simulation because we can't
do the spheres have cohesion between each other and also the simulation
crash if we dont put a range of size for the radius of the spheres.

If you can help us, to resolve this problems,we are very thankful [?]

Greetings.

 Ok i under take to correct and add comments in the

course, i will do a svn up before my modifications, after i verify YADE
correctly built.  

>Changing inputFile to TriaxialGenerator is certainly bad idea 

 Question for Triaxialtest users: Can i keep my inputparameters (for
example:isotropiccompression, translationspeed, fixedporosity) in the
generator file to realize directly the isotropic compaction by moving the
walls until a fixed porosity value ?

Thank you

No problem with the code commited, I think that we can keep it, because
it can certainly be useful, it will be ironed our progressively. Unless
you really want to revert your changes, which should be quite easy --
svn has all the history.

Nice explanation. Now just copy&paste that to
TriaxialCompressionEngine.hpp, to the big comment before "class
TriaxialCompressionEngine :-)

REFD :

contact_friction = friction_initial;
while (porosity > porosity0)
{
       contact_friction *= 0.99999; //or anything lower but close to 1
       keep stress constant;
       run a few cycles;
}
contact_friction = friction_final;// recommended at that point : 
contact_friction < friction_final, or the sample will be unstable.

This method can give you many different density values, depending on 
friction_initial and porosity0.

   The running of a Yade simulation is based on "Engines" that act on 
the sample at each time step. That are these Engines that detect the 
contacts, compute the contact forces, update positions and velocities, 
and so on...
   I say you that to let you understand that you have also to use some 
of these Engines if you want to record anything during a simulation. You 
have so to define them (if they are not yet) in the source files of your 
Preprocessor - or directly in the .xml issued from the generation of 
your preprocessor. Give a look to files like "PositionRecorder" (in 
pkg/dem/Engine/StandAloneEngine) or in the preprocessors where such 
Recorders are used.

Jerome

NB : you could have found a more explicit title, there are a lot of 
different problem you can face with Yade...

PS : in fact you can also make it with line commands in the terminal 
(sorry Vaclav for not having thinked about it ;-) ).
But for that you have to become familiar with Python commands, but this 
is maybe in fact not more complicated than Yade source files for a 
newcomer. Search about "Python" in the site or the mailing list for 
examples of such commands.

Hi,

Just saying you. If you run the Triaxialtest fle generator, normally 
YADE creates a WallStresses file in the bin directory.
This WallStresses file records differents parameters (wall forces, 
positions, porosity, ...) at each columns. You can modify the output 
parameters in the TraxialStateRecorder.cpp or inpire you in order to 
write your own file  ...Recorder.cpp
I think, it is the easiest solution, if you realized triaxial 
simulation. In all cases, the solution gave by jer?me is viable.

Cordially
JF

Hi Bruno,

   I use Yade-0.12.rc1 with Hardy Heron 8.04, it is enough: no problem 
for the installation and the classical use.

   Besides, concerning the classical triaxial tests, the new version of 
Yade, is very nice and allow to perform easily good simulations. Thank 
you for your job and thank you also to the other contributors.

    Luc

Nice, thanks! (Erratum: the TCP server runs on localhost:9000 only if
that port is free; otherwise it tries on 9001, 9002, ...). V.

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Strain compution in
	Triaxialstresscontroller
Message-ID: <200811251008209680119@yahoo.com.cn>

Hi everyone
These days I'm a little puzzled with the strain compution in TriaxialstressController.cpp ,just as follows:

strain[0] = Mathr::Log(width0/width);//Eq(1)
strain[1] = Mathr::Log(height0/height);//Eq(2)
strain[2] = Mathr::Log(depth0/depth);//Eq(3)
volumetricStrain=strain[0]+strain[1]+strain[2];//Eq(4)

IIRC,Log means not log10 but ln as usual .Is it right? 
Eq(1 to 3) is different from the common compution of strain like:
epsilon=(length-length0)/length0 
and, in PFC3D manuals(V3.0)->users' guide->problem solving with pfc3d Page 47, I found another Eq for strain compution:
epsilon=(L-L0)/((L0+L)/2)
Are the 3 methods all right? They're designed for different fields? 

Thanks for any suggestion.
Regards.

Hi,

  There is several definitions of strain, see for instance the page
about strain computation in Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics)


If I'am right (but please verify to be sure):

** Log means ln (natural logarithm),

** The way to compute strains in Yade is valid for large strains (or
large transformations), whereas the definition
epsilon=(length-length0)/length0 is valid under the hypothesis of small
strains.

** compare the results given by ln(length/length0) and
(length-length0)/length0, it is quasi the same for strains lower than
20% to 30%, when strains become too much important
(length-length0)/length0 is no longer valid.

  Best

  Luc

Yes.
The reason is very simple : d(espilon) = d(L)/L, so the total strain on
the loading is the integral of d(L)/L between L0 and L1, which is ln(L1)
- ln(L0).

> Eq(1 to 3) is different from the common compution of strain like:
> epsilon=(length-length0)/length0
This equation is usual yes, but it is wrong. It is a linear
approximation of Log(width0/width) around 1.


> and, in PFC3D manuals(V3.0)->users' guide->problem solving with pfc3d
> Page 47, I found another Eq for strain compution:

I never saw this one before...
Thinking in terms of linear approximation, I have the impression this
third expression is a 2nd order approximation while the second one is
1st order.
We don't need any approximation in Yade, and given the large deformation
of the triaxial cell, approximations would be bad.

Example when height is divided by 2 :

1st expression (exact) : eps = 0.69
2nd : eps = 0.5
3rd : eps = 0.66

Hi, svn 1393 is ages old, I would recommend svn update. I have no clue
about the problem with CohesiveTriaxial, perhaps Burno will tell you
more. For debugging, have a look here:
http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_details#Scons_options. There is
python console, if you need live debugging.

HTH, Vaclav

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] dissipating all energy in a packing
Message-ID: <49462BB8.8050605@arcig.cz>

Hi,

I need to reach as much as possible equilibrium state, with zero motion.
When using cundall's damping, I get kinetic energy dropping from 1e-3 to
1e-9, but not any lower. I suspect the cause to be the fact that
cundall's damping makes force greater against the current velocity; that
can lead to oscillations at the frequency of 2 iterations, if the force
is such that it reverses the sense of velocity during one interation,
then again etc. I suspect the same will be true for the unbalanced force
measure.

1. Is someone using some sort of viscous damping to avoid this?

2. I could try to make cundall's damping to always diminish the force
iff the coefficient is <0 (.e.g damping==-.3 would mean to always reduce
the force to ?.7), what do you think?

Regards, Vaclav

Hi Vaclav,

   I am not sure that you can do everything with the DEM! You would like 
to have a quasi perfect static case by using a dynamic method...
Whatever the method you use to damp particle movements I suspect the 
system to reach a vanishing value of kinetic energy asymptotically. 
Thus, if it the case, you can wait a very long time to obtain values of 
kinetic energy as small as you want...

But DEM is not the only method to perform discrete computations and 
static method based only on geometrical aspects without integrating 
Newton's law, allow to perform very accurate computations (for instance 
about the definitions of contact). See for intance the works done by 
Roux and Combe.

   Good luck!

   Luc

Message-ID: <358292.14087.qm@web63307.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

Hello:

I am working with the triaxial test.

Nowadays I have the version installed in my machine yade-0.12rc1

I come to the point, where I check do not obtain differences in the results.. This the well-known thing like result of activating or not activating "Rotation Blocked".

My question is, if you know if this version has some difficulty, or I am not dealing really which is the function of the parameter Rotation Blocked.

I wait, could help me with this doubt.

I am waiting for the answer.

Thank to all.

This is a very interesting problem, but honestly I thought to this hard 
(and I tried many different dampings on 1D oscillators) and couldn't 
find any good idea. I always end with the basic Cundall's damping being 
the most efficient and versatile damping.
I'm still open to suggestions though.

Note that these 2-steps oscillations are sensitive to the time 
increment, so it is just one more aspect of numerical instability with 
inapropriate timesteps (and in fact, I think Cundall's damping is so 
that if the undamped scheme is stable, the damped scheme will be stable 
too, I have no instant-proof of that though). The only question is : can 
damping revert the velocity to a greater opposite value in one (or even 
two) step? In principle it can not.

If I understand the idea above correctly, you would multiply all forces 
by 0.7 whatever the direction relative to velocity?
Well, in one sense, it would just mean a change in timescale (slowing 
down all motions by a factor of 0.7...).
The problem is it would damp no energy at all.
In terms of stability, it would have exactly the same effect as 
decreasing the time increment.

What value are you using for damping?
In order to decrease kinetic energy even more (you need to normalise 
kinetic energy with elastic energy btw, or you can't tell if the value 
is "high" or "small", why do you say it's not small enough?), I would 
set it to something around 0.1, and I would try reducing the timestep by 
a factor of ~0.8.

It is useless to increase the damping to higher values in most cases. 
The PFC default : 0.7, is some of the worst idea they had if you ask me.

Higher (than the optimal value) damping means slower convergence to 
equilibrium when "convergence" implies some rearangements in the packing 
(instead of just damped oscillations in a completely elastic problem). 
When you are close to equilibrium, you always have this last grain that 
will move a little, then trigger a local instability that will spread to 
all the sample, which leads to small changes in each particle's 
equilibrium state. This is the sort of events that can be a lot slower 
with a large damping.

The critical question : is 1e-9 more than what you would get from 
rounding errors?
Come on, you need to compare this 1e-9 with another value!

Another possible normalisation, provided you have a speed defined 
somewhere (like triaxial test at constant strain) : divide by the 
kinetic energy of the homogeneous-continuum-like velocity field.
If your configuration is purely static, I have no other idea than 
elastic energy.

And about Cundall's damping being "the best" (in my previous message), 
note that it only applies to confined packings in quasi-static 
conditions. As suggested by Feng, non-viscous damping gives unrealistic 
motions in some dynamic problems.

I think you must register as berlios.de user and Janek (as the svn
admin) will add you to the yade project. Ping Janek!! (maybe he's having
computer-free christmas?) Otherwise you can send the diff to me and I
will commit it, although you would lose the attribution of that code to
yourself.

Hello. All that you are intersted in seems to be stored
-  either in the "interactionGeometry"  (which could be of 
SphereContactGeometry type for example, see : 
pkg/dem/DataClass/InteractionGeometry/SphereContactGeometry.hpp)
 - or in the "interactionPhysics"(which could be of 
"ElasticContactInteraction" type, see : 
pkg/dem/DataClass/InteractionPhysics/ElasticContactInteraction.hpp)
So what you have to do is to create your own Engine which will loop over 
all the interactions (like that :
    InteractionContainer::iterator ii    = 
ncb->transientInteractions->begin();
    InteractionContainer::iterator iiEnd = 
ncb->transientInteractions->end();
    for(  ; ii!=iiEnd ; ++ii ) {
)
and will store in output files the things you need (see for example all 
Engines "...Recorder")

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Viscous damping code for YADE
Message-ID: <20081222153634.9997.80048.launchpad@palladium.canonical.com>

Hi, all:

I am about to release the viscous damping code for YADE SVN, this damping is different from the non-viscous damping and the damping effect only exist when particles are in contact, the basic equations are similar to:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping

In some conditions, this is more realistic than the non-viscous damping. Two verification problems are listed in:

Feng Chen, Eric. C. Drumm, and Georges Guiochon ?Prediction/Verification of Particle Motion in One Dimension with the Discrete-Element Method?. International Journal of Geomechanics, ASCE, Volume 7, Issue 5, pp. 344-352 2007 

One thing is I only tested it with YADE-0.11.1, it might take some time to compile with the latest SVN, hope this would be helpful.

Merry Christmas!

Hi, Bruno:

This is a post that I have sent to Vaclav already,

1. Actually, the non-viscous damping (or say local damping in PFC's manual) is not a proper energy dissipation method for some problems, which will create unrealistic results, since the model its self is not very realistic under some conditions, think about a rock free fall, use damping coefficient alpha=XXX, I think it unreasonable for reducing its kinetic energy YYY while it is flying in the air since the resistance is not so 
great, in some problem (for example, fluid) you should set the XXX to zero and use viscous damping instead to produce meaningful results.

2. I doubt whether it is good to use kinetic energy to evaluate the degree that the system comes to equilibrium, since for a mass-spring system, when the kinetic energy is zero, the potential energy is the maximum, if you want to use some criterion to stop the simulation, you cannot use the kinetic energy alone to judge.

I am trying to post viscous damping that I am using and shown some verification in one of our publications (1D DEM paper in the publications page), after I discuss with my advisor I would like to release the viscous damping code to SVN, but I don't know if it will reduce the energy from 1e-3 to 1e-9 and then  to any further in your problem.

This is a very interesting problem, but honestly I thought to this hard 
(and I tried many different dampings on 1D oscillators) and couldn't 
find any good idea. I always end with the basic Cundall's damping being 
the most efficient and versatile damping.
I'm still open to suggestions though.

Note that these 2-steps oscillations are sensitive to the time 
increment, so it is just one more aspect of numerical instability with 
inapropriate timesteps (and in fact, I think Cundall's damping is so 
that if the undamped scheme is stable, the damped scheme will be stable 
too, I have no instant-proof of that though). The only question is : can 
damping revert the velocity to a greater opposite value in one (or even 
two) step? In principle it can not.

If I understand the idea above correctly, you would multiply all forces 
by 0.7 whatever the direction relative to velocity?
Well, in one sense, it would just mean a change in timescale (slowing 
down all motions by a factor of 0.7...).
The problem is it would damp no energy at all.
In terms of stability, it would have exactly the same effect as 
decreasing the time increment.

What value are you using for damping?
In order to decrease kinetic energy even more (you need to normalise 
kinetic energy with elastic energy btw, or you can't tell if the value 
is "high" or "small", why do you say it's not small enough?), I would 
set it to something around 0.1, and I would try reducing the timestep by 
a factor of ~0.8.

It is useless to increase the damping to higher values in most cases. 
The PFC default : 0.7, is some of the worst idea they had if you ask me.

Higher (than the optimal value) damping means slower convergence to 
equilibrium when "convergence" implies some rearangements in the packing 
(instead of just damped oscillations in a completely elastic problem). 
When you are close to equilibrium, you always have this last grain that 
will move a little, then trigger a local instability that will spread to 
all the sample, which leads to small changes in each particle's 
equilibrium state. This is the sort of events that can be a lot slower 
with a large damping.

Bruno

Subject: [deprecated list] [Yade-users] Simulation with CohesiveTriaxialTest
Message-ID: <200811291632331560958@yahoo.com.cn>

Hi 
I installed yade-1393 and want to do a simulation with CohesiveTriaxialTest Module.But I find a problem: simulation can't move on when the isocompression almost finish. The packs seems can't reached equilibrium--the computing steps keeping increasing, it takes much more time than TriaxialTest simulation . Does CohesiveTriaxialTest need more steps or time to reach equilibrium than TriaxialTest? 
Is it possible to run yade in a debug mode? or compile/debug it in another IDE such as KDevelop?I think it's better for debugging/developing new module.
Thank you!

At present condintion i am getting data as follows (in certain step level data for strain or stress)

step s1 s2 s3 e1 e2 e3...
2000
2100

But I want to see particulate information in every step or in certain axail strain level.So that after extraction data I can plot polar diagram or rose diagram,that is next step case so that I can?study the distribution of contacts orientation or anything in particulate level.

Can anybody give me idea to extract Fabric data?
